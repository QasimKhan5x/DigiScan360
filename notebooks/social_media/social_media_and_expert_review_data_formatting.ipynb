ComfoBuds 2            |1More has a slightly different take on the standard AirPods for those who have trouble keeping them in their ears. The ComfoBuds 2 have mini ear tips on them that help secure them in your ear. This second-gen version offers improved sound from the originals with better bass (it's still not great sound, but it's good for the money). As their name implies, they're lightweight, comfortable to wear and work well for making calls. It's worth noting that their charging case is remarkably narrow and compact. It looks like a tiny hot-dog bun. They're IPX5 splashproof and also available in black.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |8.560909000464063|\n|1More Fit SE S30             |1More makes a couple of open sports earbuds with ear hooks. The  buds are the flagship and feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). But I like the fit a little better on the step down S30, which is IPX5 splash-proof (can sustain a spray of water) and costs half the price, making it a better value.The case is bulky and feels a little cheap (the lid is flimsy) but the buds themselves seem sturdily built and the ear hooks are nice and flexible. They have 14.2mm drivers that output decent but not great sound (there's a bit of distortion at higher volumes), which is par for the course for these types of open buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. They're also good but not great for voice calling. A companion app for iOS and Android allows you to tweak the sound with an equalizer and you can update the buds' firmware. The buds are available in black or white and offer up to 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |8.098824669258144|\n|1More SonoFlow               |The design of 1More's SonoFlow headphones reminds me a little of some earlier Sony headphones and also the newer Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 4. They're a bit generic looking but sleek enough and more importantly, comfortable to wear. They also feature very respectable sound quality. While it doesn't quite measure up to the sound quality of what'll get with more premium models like the Momentum Wireless 4, it isn't that far off. The SonoFlow headphones deliver smooth sound with good clarity and relatively well-defined bass (they're just not quite as rich or dynamic sounding as those premium models I mentioned). They also have support for the LDAC audio codec.The noise canceling is a step down from what Sony and Bose models offer but it does a decent job of muffling ambient sound and there is a transparency mode. Voice-calling performance is similarly solid but unspectacular. Note that you can use this in wired mode with the included cable but the noise canceling only works in wireless mode, which is an issue for frequent flyers who like some noise canceling when plugging into an in-flight entertainment system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |7.931445194337092|\n|AirPods (2nd Gen)            |The new AirPods (third gen) are a nice upgrade over the second-gen AirPods.

Also, battery life is better, and the AirPods 3 are officially water-resistant.They're a good pick for students who prefer \"open earbuds\" and don't like noise-isolating earbuds with tips they have to jam in their ears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |8.310724216599867|\n|AirPods 3rd Generation       |Take one look at the new design of the third-gen AirPods, and the first thing you'll probably think is: \"Those look like the AirPods Pro without ear tips.\" You wouldn't be wrong. While they're more fraternal than identical twins, the AirPods 3rd Generation are shaped like the AirPods Pro, with the same shorter stems and same pinch controls as those of the Pro. Aside from the design change, which should fit most ears better than the AirPods 2nd Generation (though not very small ears), the biggest change is to the sound quality: It's much improved. Also, battery life is better, and the AirPods 3 are officially water-resistant and support Apple's spatial audio virtual surround feature (for Apple users only).  Like AirPods Pro, the AirPods are top-notch for making voice calls. Callers said they could hear me clearly even with a lot background noise in the streets of New York City. The only issue is that since they are open earbuds, they let sound in, so you may not be able to hear callers as well as they can hear you in noisier environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |8.815507963597835|\n|Amazon Echo Buds 2023        |Amazon's 2023 Echo Buds impressed me in a few ways that I wasn't expecting. For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that of Apple's AirPods 3, which deliver fuller bass and overall fuller, smoother sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 3 cost around $150 and offer only about 15% to 20% better audio. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or \"semi-open\" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |8.591327881325212|\n|Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC |New for 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than last year's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.                                                          |8.205164566453872|\n|Anker Soundcore Life Q20     |Anker's Soundcore Life Q20 is arguably the best value in noise-canceling headphones. Not only do these over-ear headphones sound decent for their regular list price of $60 (they often sell for $10 less), but they're also comfortable to wear thanks to the nicely padded, secure ear cups.No, the Life Q20 doesn't sound as good as premium Bluetooth headphones such as the Sony WH-1000XM3, but the audio quality isn't bad, which is all you can ask for noise-canceling headphones at this price. This wireless headphone has fairly well balanced sound with a reasonable amount of clarity and plump bass that's not bloated or muddy (there's a bass boost or BassUp mode if you want an extra helping of bass with your music). Also, the noise cancellation is acceptably effective and this earphone is a solid wireless headset for making calls. Battery life on this wireless earphone is good at 40 hours. A simple carrying pouch is included.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |8.107412301636126|\n|Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Plus|Anker's Soundcore Life Q20 Plus is among the best values in noise-canceling headphones. Not only do these budget noise-canceling over-ear headphones sound quite decent for around $40, they're also comfortable to wear thanks to their puffy ear pads. Compared to the earlier Life Q20, this Plus model adds app support and USB-C charging (instead of Micro-USB) for $10 more.No, the Life Q20 Plus doesn't sound nearly as good as premium Bluetooth headphones such as the Sony WH-1000XM5, but the audio quality sounds pretty good, which is all you can ask for noise-canceling headphones at this price. It's fairly well balanced with a reasonable amount of clarity and plump bass that's not bloated or muddy (there's a bass boost or BassUp mode if you want an extra helping of bass with your music). Also, the noise cancelation is acceptably effective at noise reduction and blocking out ambient sound and it's decent enough as a headset for making calls. Battery life is good at 40 hours.

It doesn't have quite the clarity or bass definition as some of the top premium models, but it's less than a third of the price and gets you about 75% of the way there in terms of sound. It's well balanced overall, with punchy bass, and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound. Noise canceling is good for the price, though certainly not up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones. Battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USB-C charging.The only area where the Q30 falls a little short is for voice calls. It picks up your voice fine in quieter environments but it just doesn't reduce background noise all that well. Compared to the Q20 (see below), the Q30 does offer improved sound (it's not a huge difference, but it definitely is a notch up) and a more premium design. There's also the newer  ($100), which adds support for Sony's LDAC audio codec for high-resolution audio streaming with music services that support it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |8.25119403996745 |\n|Anker Soundcore Space One    |Available in three color options, the Soundcore Space One are Anker's latest noise-canceling headphones and a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space Ones sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users.I found them comfortable to wear, but they do look a bit bulky compared to more premium models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |7.988078599064024|\n|Anker Soundcore Sport X10    |The Soundcore Sport X10 have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks that flip up when you're using them and flip down when you want to set them in their charging case, which has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. As long as you get a tight seal, they sound good, with powerful, punchy bass and good detail. They also have active noise canceling, which is effective but not as good as Sony's or Bose's noise canceling. They're also fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating, which means they can be fully submerged in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes.

They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |8.59679266972112 |\n|Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX    |Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay HX headphones are the successor to the company's H9 series headphones (the X is the Roman numeral for 10) and, like those earlier H9 models, the HX headphones carry a list price of $599 (some colors are discounted at Amazon). That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads.The HX have custom 40mm drivers, Bluetooth 5.1 and support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive (that includes AptX HD) for high-resolution wireless streaming when you combine an aptX-enabled Android device with certain music-streaming services like Qobuz.Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound, overall well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. If you want to push the treble or bass, you can tweak the EQ in the Bang & Olufsen app for iOS and Android and give the headphones a warmer or brighter profile. Their noise canceling is also very good and voice-calling capabilities are also quite solid. Additionally, they offer multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them with a smartphone and PC simultaneously (Microsoft Swift Pair-enabled for Windows machines) so you can easily switch between the two. Battery life is rated at up to 35 hours with noise canceling on and 40 hours with it off.Earlier Bang & Olufsen models included a soft case (a pouch really), but the HX headphones come with a hard case. As I said, they're expensive, but the small improvements over earlier flagship Bang & Olufsen noise-canceling headphones help make the HX headphones a worthy alternative to the AirPods Max.|8.01099742182878 |\n|Baseus Bowie MA10            |Priced at just $28 after you click an instant 20% discount coupon on Amazon, the Baseus Bowie MA10 delivers surprisingly good sound along with active noise canceling for its low price (you just don't see too many active noise canceling earbuds at this price). They're IPX6 water resistant (can withstand a strong spray of water) and also have multipoint Bluetooth pairing and connect to a companion app. They stick out of your ears a bit but they did fit my ears comfortably.The earbuds deliver impressive battery life, offering up to 8 hours on a single charger at moderate volume levels with an extra 132 hours in the charging case. Yes, you heard right -- 132 hours. The one big downside to these buds is that their charging case is rather large and bulky. If you can live with that, these are a very nice bargain. ProsLow priceSurprisingly good sound for the moneyActive noise canceling and multipoint BluetoothStrong battery lifeConsCharging case is bulkyEarbuds are little big                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |8.358757181497866|\n|Baseus Eli Sport 1           |Baseus is a value brand that makes well-designed charging products and earbuds. The Eli Sport 1 can be had for around $50 when you apply an instant 30% off discount coupon on Amazon. And while they may not sound quite as good as some of the premium open earbuds out there -- there can be a touch of distortion at higher volumes with bass-heavy tracks -- they sound quite decent for their modest price and I found them comfortable to wear. They look more premium than their price would indicate. They have 16.2mm drivers, are IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 7.5 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels. I also liked that their case is relatively compact for this type of ear-hook style earbud and they come with a detachable neckband like some competitors. Voice-calling performance is also pretty good, though not great.

The new DT 700 X is easier to drive than the 770 Pro, thanks to the company's new STELLAR.45 sound transducer with an impedance of 48 ohms, so it plays better with smartphones, tablets and laptops without requiring a headphone amp.The headphone is targeted at content creators who want accurate audio reproduction, but it's a bit more dynamic sounding and less bass-shy than many studio headphones, which tend to restrain the bass and hew toward a very neutral sound profile. The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in. This closed-back version is more versatile.

As their name implies, they're lightweight, comfortable to wear and work well for making calls. It's worth noting that their charging case is remarkably narrow and compact.

But I like the fit a little better on the step down S30, which is IPX5 splash-proof (can sustain a spray of water) and costs half the price, making it a better value.The case is bulky and feels a little cheap (the lid is flimsy) but the buds themselves seem sturdily built and the ear hooks are nice and flexible. They have 14.2mm drivers that output decent but not great sound (there's a bit of distortion at higher volumes), which is par for the course for these types of open buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. They're also good but not great for voice calling. A companion app for iOS and Android allows you to tweak the sound with an equalizer and you can update the buds' firmware. The buds are available in black or white and offer up to 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.","2":"Comfortable fit, Affordable price, Good sound for open earbuds, Good battery life","3":"Design is a bit plain, Case lid feels slightly flimsy","4":"8.1","index":2},{"0":"1More SonoFlow","1":"The design of 1More's SonoFlow headphones reminds me a little of some earlier Sony headphones and also the newer Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 4.

While it doesn't quite measure up to the sound quality of what'll get with more premium models like the Momentum Wireless 4, it isn't that far off. The SonoFlow headphones deliver smooth sound with good clarity and relatively well-defined bass (they're just not quite as rich or dynamic sounding as those premium models I mentioned). They also have support for the LDAC audio codec.The noise canceling is a step down from what Sony and Bose models offer but it does a decent job of muffling ambient sound and there is a transparency mode. Voice-calling performance is similarly solid but unspectacular. Note that you can use this in wired mode with the included cable but the noise canceling only works in wireless mode, which is an issue for frequent flyers who like some noise canceling when plugging into an in-flight entertainment system.","2":"","3":"","4":"7.9","index":3},{"0":"AirPods (2nd Gen)","1":"The new AirPods (third gen) are a nice upgrade over the second-gen AirPods.

For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that of Apple's AirPods 3, which deliver fuller bass and overall fuller, smoother sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 3 cost around $150 and offer only about 15% to 20% better audio. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or \"semi-open\" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale.","2":"Well-designed inexpensive earbuds, Good sound for open earbuds, Strong feature set, including hands-free Alexa","3":"May not fit everyone's ears comfortably, Not a ton of bass, No ANC (they're open earbuds)","4":"8.6","index":8},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC","1":"New for 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than last year's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.","2":"More affordable and better than Liberty 4 buds, Comfortable fit with upgraded sound and noise canceling, Robust feature set and solid call quality","3":"Noise canceling could be a little better","4":"8.2","index":9},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Life Q20","1":"Anker's Soundcore Life Q20 is arguably the best value in noise-canceling headphones.

This wireless headphone has fairly well balanced sound with a reasonable amount of clarity and plump bass that's not bloated or muddy (there's a bass boost or BassUp mode if you want an extra helping of bass with your music).

It's well balanced overall, with punchy bass, and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound. Noise canceling is good for the price, though certainly not up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones. Battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USB-C charging.The only area where the Q30 falls a little short is for voice calls. It picks up your voice fine in quieter environments but it just doesn't reduce background noise all that well. Compared to the Q20 (see below), the Q30 does offer improved sound (it's not a huge difference, but it definitely is a notch up) and a more premium design.

That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads.The HX have custom 40mm drivers, Bluetooth 5.1 and support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive (that includes AptX HD) for high-resolution wireless streaming when you combine an aptX-enabled Android device with certain music-streaming services like Qobuz.Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound, overall well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. If you want to push the treble or bass, you can tweak the EQ in the Bang & Olufsen app for iOS and Android and give the headphones a warmer or brighter profile. Their noise canceling is also very good and voice-calling capabilities are also quite solid. Additionally, they offer multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them with a smartphone and PC simultaneously (Microsoft Swift Pair-enabled for Windows machines) so you can easily switch between the two.

The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in.

They're very accurate sounding. What's also nice is that the earbuds come with 10 ear tips of varying sizes, as well as a mix of silicone and foam tips (I was able to get a tight seal with the 3XL size ear tips). The neckband has a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and amplifier courtesy of AKM, and there's support for Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec for Android and other devices that support it (the LHDC codec is also supported).

That design could be appealing to people who don't like having headphones in or on their ears and also offers a degree of safety for runners and bikers who want their ears open to the world.Bose has updated its line of audio sunglasses with three new models, including the Tempo sports model, which offers better sound and battery life than the more traditional-looking Tenor and Soprano. The Tempo has better specs all around, with USB-C charging and larger 22mm drivers. It also delivers up to 8 hours of battery life.Their sound is definitely improved from the original Frames. Bose says the Tempo plays \"deeper and louder -- loud enough for cycling at 25 mph -- while [you're] still able to hear traffic and your training partners.\" They're sweat-, weather-, scratch- and shatter-resistant, according to Bose, and fit under most protective helmets.

The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). The QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling, and strong voice-calling performance.  As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \"visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \"help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com. While the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than over the course of the year -- so look to buy them when they're on sale.

When they finally hit stores, the PX8's price jumped to $699 or a full $300 more than the company's step-down PX7 S2 headphones, which are also excellent (see below).The biggest difference between the PX8, which weigh in at 320 grams, and the PX7 S2 are the PX8's all-new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are \"inspired\" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 Series loudspeaker line. Bowers & Wilkins says these units help deliver superior resolution, detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the PX7 S2.Based on my tests, that's true. While I liked the PX7 S2, the PX8 headphones do sound more special, with a touch more openness and overall clarity. They're right near the top for sound in Bluetooth headphones and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions (there's no listening fatigue with these guys). For the best sound, you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USB-C to USB-C cable. As for the noise-canceling function, it's good but not quite on par with what you get from Sony's WH-1000XM5. And while the voice-calling capabilities are solid, these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls (the transparency mode is top-notch). While I can't say they're worth $300 more than the PX7 S2, they're a great set of cans if you can afford them. I do prefer the sound and overall performance of the more expensive Focal Bathys, though the Bathys don't have such strong noise canceling, but the PX8 headphones are a close second.","2":"Swanky style, Highly accurate sound, USB-C wired support","3":"Expensive, Noise-canceling can be better","4":"8.0","index":37},{"0":"Cleer Audio Arc 2 Sport","1":"Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them.

That said, not everyone loves this style of open earbuds, which lets sound in so you can hear ambient sound around you for safety purposes.With a new six-axis motion sensor, you can actually control the buds with head gestures -- you answer calls by nodding and skip tracks forward by turning your head to the right and skip a track back by turning your head left. Thankfully, those motion controls can be turned off if you don't want to use them. These are among the first buds to support Qualcomm's aptX Lossless format, if you're one of the few to have an Android device that supports that audio codec (plenty of Android phones support aptX Adaptive). Since these aren't high-end noise-isolating earbuds, you probably won't be able to tell the difference in sound quality -- I couldn't -- but all that aside, these do sound very good for open-style earbuds. They lack a bit of oomph to their bass but they're punchy enough, offer good clarity and didn't distort at higher volumes. They also played sufficiently loud. They have an IPX5 water- and sweat-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water, and battery life is very good at up to eight hours on a single charge, plus there's a little more than three additional charges in the slim but still somewhat bulky charging case. It's big compared to an AirPods charging case, but svelte compared to other cases that house this style of earbuds.These offer respectable performance for voice calls, but callers did say they heard a certain amount of white noise when I spoke to them from the noisy streets of New York -- that whooshing sound is the by-product of the earbuds' noise-reduction efforts.","2":"","3":"","4":"7.9","index":38},{"0":"Creative Sound Blaster Jam V2","1":"I was a fan of Creative's original Sound Blaster Jam headphones that came out in 2015 and had a decidedly retro look and feel, with good sound for the money.

Well, the second-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours and added a quick-charge feature. It also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 one of the best new noise-canceling headphones. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They have excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure calls them \"studio headphones\" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference).Equipped with three microphones in each ear cup, I found the call quality to be good with decent noise reduction, and there's an adjustable sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice. I wouldn't say they're exceptionally good for calls in noisier environments.The headphones do have some extra features worth noting. They offer both LDAC and aptX support for Android and other devices that support those audio codecs. You can connect the headphones to a computer or smartphone with a USB-C cable for hi-res audio transmission or use the included analog cable if your device has a 3.5mm headphone port. That said, I found they played a little louder using a wireless Bluetooth connection (with LDAC) than when I connected them to a Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 via USB-C.","2":"Good build quality, Excellent sound quality Improved noise canceling, USB-C audio plus LDAC and aptX audio codec support","3":"Somewhat heavy, Carrying case is still a bit large","4":"8.5","index":101},{"0":"Skullcandy Grom Wireless","1":"Skullcandy's Grom Wireless over-ear headphones are being targeted at kids, and they're a good choice for the 12-and-under set.

Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, they're IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 17 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels (expect to get less than that because you will likely play these at high volume levels, especially outdoors where you'll encounter more ambient noise). They also work decently for making voice calls but don't expect business-class performance.","2":"","3":"","4":"8.2","index":131},{"0":"Status Between 3ANC","1":"Status Audio's earbuds aren't exactly the sleekest or most attractive earbuds you can buy, but if you don't mind their utilitarian look and giant stems, you are getting an excellent sounding set of earbuds. The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, though they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.While they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors, and they only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's in part due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side -- they feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water. The companion app for iOS is fairly basic, but you can upgrade the firmware and tweak the sound profile with a customizable EQ option.","2":"Excellent sound and a comfortable, secure fit, Good noise canceling and call quality, Multipoint Bluetooth pairing&nbsp;, Good battery life","3":"They're big, No ear-detection sensors","4":"8.0","index":132},{"0":"SteelSeries Arctis 1","1":"If you want a much more affordable alternative to the 9X, check out the Arctis 1, a well-designed (but less swanky) wireless model that sells for about $90. While you need to use a dongle (included), it works when connected to Xbox, Switch, PlayStation or even Android (the USB-C dongle includes a USB-A adapter cable). It's a good value, with a detachable Discord-certified microphone, and battery life is rated at up to 20 hours, which is pretty decent.","2":"","3":"","4":"8.4","index":133},{"0":"SteelSeries Arctis 9X Wireless","1":"On the PlayStation and PC side, Arctis has its high-end Pro Wireless ($220), which some say is the best all-around headset for both those platforms. But for Xbox, the Arctis 9X Wireless is an excellent choice if you're looking for a more premium wireless headset. It connects directly to the Xbox wirelessly without a dongle and can also be used with your phone with a Bluetooth connection. It delivers 20 hours of battery life.","2":"","3":"","4":"8.4","index":134},{"0":"Technics EAH-AZ60","1":"Panasonic's Technics EAH-AZ60 buds don't have quite as premium a feel as the earlier EAH-AZ70W, but they sound sweet with clean, well-balanced sound, well-defined bass and good detail. They feature active noise canceling (it's good), a transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth pairing (so you can connect to your computer and phone at the same time) and they have very solid voice-calling performance with good noise reduction. The buds are IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 7 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels. They're missing some features usually found at this price point: Notably, an ear-detection sensor that automatically pauses your music when you pull the earbuds out of your ears, and wireless charging (the former feature is more important). The step-down EAH-AZ40 also sounds good but the EAH-AZ60 not only has larger drivers (8mm compared to 6mm) but also supports Sony's LDAC audio codec and has two additional microphones for voice calling and noise canceling (the EAH-AZ40 doesn't have noise canceling).","2":"","3":"","4":"8.0","index":135},{"0":"Technics EAH-AZ80","1":"You should expect a lot from earbuds that cost $300 -- and yes, that's still a lot to pay for headphones, even if plenty of people seem to be willing to pay upwards of $450 for the likes of Apple's AirPods Max headphones. Overall, Panasonic has done a nice job of creating an all-around top-performing set of buds that offer an improved fit with terrific sound, very good noise canceling and a robust feature set.Voice-calling capabilities are decent but don't quite live up to their billing (yet). Hopefully we'll see some firmware upgrades that improve the voice-calling experience in noisier environments. Despite that caveat, as long as they fit your ears well, the Technics EAH-AZ80 are right up there with the best wireless earbuds on the market right now.","2":"Stellar sound and good noise canceling with improved fit, Good battery life, LDAC audio codec support for Android devices","3":"Pricey, Voice-calling performance is decent but could be slightly better","4":"8.5","index":136},{"0":"Tranya Nova","1":"Tranya's Nova earbuds not only sound surprisingly good but also offer good noise-canceling performance for their modest price. Although you can tweak their sound with the equalizer in Tranya's companion app, at their balanced setting, they seem a bit more tuned to today's popular music, including hip hop and rap, delivering a full dose of bass (the buds have 12mm drivers) while not sounding boomy. Equipped with a Qualcomm 3072 chip that supports Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec and LE Audio, they're IPX5 splashproof and also have an ambient mode that lets sound in, plus a low-latency gaming mode. Multipoint Bluetooth pairing is supported as well.Battery life is rated at six hours at moderate volume levels with noise canceling on (I got more like five hours) and up to nine hours with ANC off. The glossy black charging case, which offers wireless charging, does show fingerprints but is easy enough to wipe down, as are the buds themselves. I thought the touch controls worked well, and callers said that while they heard a lot of background noise, they could hear my voice clearly during calls (the buds have three mics on each bud).While they're missing such premium features as ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the buds out of your ears, you couldn't ask for too much more from buds in this price range.","2":"Lightweight and attractively designed, Very good sound and good noise canceling for the price, Solid feature set, IPX5 splashproof","3":"Glossy finish shows fingerprints, No ear-detection sensors","4":"8.7","index":137},{"0":"Tranya T20","1":"The Tranya T20 reminds me a little of a cheaper version of Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 without the noise canceling. They're pretty no-frills and missing more premium features such as an ear-detection sensor that automatically pauses your music when you take a bud out of your ears. They sound surprisingly decent for their modest price, if you get a tight seal, they sit pretty flush with your ears (they don't really stick out much) and they have decent battery life -- up to eight hours at moderate volume levels. They also work pretty well for making calls and are IPX7 waterproof.  The case feels a little cheap and the buds are lightweight. The Galaxy Buds 2 definitely feels more premium. The buds are well-tuned and have a relatively wide soundstage. Don't expect the world from them and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.","2":"Good price, Surprisingly good sound for the money, Relatively compact, Strong battery life and IPX7 waterproof","3":"No active noise canceling, Case feels a little cheap","4":"8.5","index":138},{"0":"Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2","1":"If you can't quite afford Turtle Beach's Stealth 700 Gen 2, the Stealth 600 Gen 2 is a good alternative at under $100. While it doesn't have the more premium build quality of the Stealth 700, it's a very comfortable headset with good sound and performance. The audio quality has been improved slightly, and like the Stealth 700, it's equipped with a larger  high-sensitivity flip-to-mute mic that seamlessly integrates into the headset when retracted (muted). An audio preset button on the left ear cup allows you to quickly customize your audio, and thanks to Xbox Wireless technology, it's easy to connect to your Xbox. Battery life is rated at 15 hours, and the headset recharges via USB-C. The headset is pictured in white but is more readily available in black. The PlayStation version includes a dongle for wireless connectivity with the PS4 and PS5.","2":"","3":"","4":"8.2","index":139},{"0":"Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2","1":"Turtle Beach has upgraded its popular Stealth 700 headset, improving both its performance and comfort. The build quality is solid and I liked the \"cooling gel-infused\" memory foam ear cushions, which really fit my head nicely and play well with glasses. The headband is also sturdy and well-padded.Turtle Beach says this Gen 2 model has improved 50mm Nanoclear drivers -- the sound is more detailed and \"precise\" -- there's a redesigned metal-reinforced headband and a larger, high-sensitivity flip-to-mute mic. Its engineers tuned it to deliver even \"more detailed and precise  sound.\" I thought it sounded quite good, and the headset pairs to your phone and is also good for music listening and taking calls while you're gaming. There's an \"all-new\" Turtle Beach Hub app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak the audio and remap buttons. This headset will work with older Xbox One consoles as well as the next-gen Series consoles. Battery life is now up to 20 hours -- the headset charges via USB-C -- and thanks to Xbox Wireless technology, you can connect wirelessly to the Xbox without using a dongle like you have to do with the PS4. If you're looking at this versus the step-down Stealth 600 Gen 2, which retails for $80, that model is also good but the Stealth 700 Gen definitely has a more premium feel to it. It's really a good Xbox wireless headset for around $180.","2":"","3":"","4":"8.0","index":140},{"0":"V-Moda M-200","1":"V-Moda's M-200 is one of the few wired headphones on this list. Released in late 2019, these clean- and detailed-sounding over-ear headphones have excellent bass response, and the cushy earcups mean they're also comfortable to wear. Featuring 50mm drivers with neodymium magnets, CCAW voice coils and fine-tuning by Roland engineers -- yes, V-Moda is now owned by Roland -- the M‑200 is Hi‑Res Audio-certified by the Japan Audio Society. Other V-Moda headphones tend to push the bass a little, but this set has the more neutral profile that you'd expect from studio monitor headphones. They come with two cords, one of which has a built-in microphone for making calls. It would be nice if V-Moda offered Lightning or USB-C cables for phones without headphone jacks.Note that last year V-Moda released the  ($350), a wireless version of these headphones that includes active noise canceling. They also sound great, but their noise cancellation, call quality and overall feature set don't match those of the AirPods Max.","2":"Comfortable, Excellent sound, Includes a second cord with an

They have 14.2mm drivers that output decent but not great sound (there's a bit of distortion at higher volumes), which is par for the course for these types of open buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. They're also good but not great for voice calling. A companion app for iOS and Android allows you to tweak the sound with an equalizer and you can update the buds' firmware.

They're a bit generic looking but sleek enough and more importantly, comfortable to wear. They also feature very respectable sound quality. While it doesn't quite measure up to the sound quality of what'll get with more premium models like the Momentum Wireless 4, it isn't that far off. The SonoFlow headphones deliver smooth sound with good clarity and relatively well-defined bass (they're just not quite as rich or dynamic sounding as those premium models I mentioned). They also have support for the LDAC audio codec.The noise canceling is a step down from what Sony and Bose models offer but it does a decent job of muffling ambient sound and there is a transparency mode. Voice-calling performance is similarly solid but unspectacular. Note that you can use this in wired mode with the included cable but the noise canceling only works in wireless mode, which is an issue for frequent flyers who like some noise canceling when plugging into an in-flight entertainment system.","3":"185","4":"0.9887","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,1.4015720636073625,0,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.5991182309116689,1.647323431011023,0,0,1.8969877447375798,2.0794415416798357,0.4671906878691208,0,0,1.2669476034873244,0.321098069371625,0,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,0.9056001223312122,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,0.8899351021688214,0,0,0,0.8489946694180636,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.469756816840031,1.8686169507593284,0,0.8250645506625137,0,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,0,0,0.4781806025991309,0,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0,3.447493703492823,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0,2.0059190453910123,0,0,0,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6326847877140319,0,0,1.5022688764205891,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6791609385852054]},"index":3},{"0":"AirPods (2nd Gen)","1":"The new AirPods (third gen) are a nice upgrade over the second-gen AirPods.

For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that of Apple's AirPods 3, which deliver fuller bass and overall fuller, smoother sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 3 cost around $150 and offer only about 15% to 20% better audio. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or \"semi-open\" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale.","3":"153","4":"0.9845","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0,1.5022688764205891,0,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,0,0.9343813757382416,0,0,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,0,0.3018667074437374,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0.561377902928822,0,0,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,1.5320801508530675,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0,0,0.6653676164528696,0,0,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,0,0,2.829327262207607,0,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,1.0263516022218886,0,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0,0,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"index":8},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC","1":"New for 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than last year's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.","3":"313","4":"0.9981","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,2.3359534393456043,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0,1.469756816840031,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.2843922774865,3.9547226936246247,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,0,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,6.250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,2.245511611715288,0.9056001223312122,2.0876081043462293,0,1.2501874346298594,2.113066952106162,2.829327262207607,0,0.8899351021688214,2.0427735344707565,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,3.9922056987172176,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,0.5977257532489136,0,0.8489946694180636,0,1.2501874346298594,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.509333537218687,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,2.3443193631168704,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,2.84548161710637,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0,1.5022688764205891,1.8035360373333535,0.5738004229273791,0,0]},"index":9},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Life Q20","1":"Anker's Soundcore Life Q20 is arguably the best value in noise-canceling headphones.

A simple carrying pouch is included.","3":"169","4":"0.9901","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0,0.7363193524251541,1.875281151944789,1.1982364618233379,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,0,0.9484938723687899,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,0,0,1.2843922774865,1.318240897874875,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0,0,0,0,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,1.0438040521731147,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0,0,2.486078017668508,1.9336860220739729,0.565996446278709,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0,1.3021154416566612,0,0,0,0,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,0.9343084753796642,1.9552858931912729,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,0,1.131992892557418,1.0045833390198333,0,1.149164567830941,0,0,0,1.1727584102684785,0,1.6078006640028795,0.5131758011109443,0,0,1.0029595226955061,0.8126923312097281,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,0,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,1.122755805857644,0]},"index":11},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Life Q30","1":"As far as sound, comfort level and build quality go, you'd be hard-pressed to do better than Anker's Soundcore Life Q30 for the money. It doesn't have quite the clarity or bass definition as some of the top premium models, but it's less than a third of the price and gets you about 75% of the way there in terms of sound. It's well balanced overall, with punchy bass, and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound. Noise canceling is good for the price, though certainly not up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones. Battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USB-C charging.The only area where the Q30 falls a little short is for voice calls. It picks up your voice fine in quieter environments but it just doesn't reduce background noise all that well. Compared to the Q20 (see below), the Q30 does offer improved sound (it's not a huge difference, but it definitely is a notch up) and a more premium design. There's also the newer  ($100), which adds support for Sony's LDAC audio codec for high-resolution audio streaming with music services that support it.","3":"198","4":"0.9885","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,1.4015720636073625,0.9569804862461084,0,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,0.7969439742415889,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,1.1727584102684785,0,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6037334148874748,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0,0.561377902928822,1.509333537218687,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,0.5106933836176891,2.486078017668508,1.9336860220739729,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0,0.4746563726123323,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0,1.5323446311496702,0.9798378778933541,1.5571807922994405,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0,0.8039003320014397,0,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0.8126923312097281,0,0,1.362826163040005,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,2.037482815755616]},"index":12},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Space One","1":"Available in three color options, the Soundcore Space One are Anker's latest noise-canceling headphones and a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space Ones sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users.I found them comfortable to wear, but they do look a bit bulky compared to more premium models.","3":"208","4":"0.9945","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,1.647323431011023,0,1.0029595226955061,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0.7073318155519017,0,1.7798702043376429,0,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0,1.4354707293691626,0,1.9961028493586088,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.2457446338395524,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,0,2.0097508300035996,0,0.4781806025991309,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.2074668297749496,0,2.345516820536957,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,4.0634616560486405,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.5022688764205891,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"index":13},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Sport X10","1":"The Soundcore Sport X10 have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks that flip up when you're using them and flip down when you want to set them in their charging case, which has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. As long as you get a tight seal, they sound good, with powerful, punchy bass and good detail.

They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions.","3":"97","4":"0.9883","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0,0,0,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,0,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,1.0438040521731147,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0.7073318155519017,0,0,0,0,0,0.565996446278709,0,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,0.6120216357475768,0,0.7363193524251541,0,0,1.469756816840031,0.6228723169197762,0,0,0,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.8039003320014397,0,0.11954515064978273,1.9336860220739729,0.2829982231393545,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.6037334148874748,1.318240897874875,0,0,0,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.21089492923801065,0,0,0,0.36070720746667073,0,0,0.6791609385852054]},"index":17},{"0":"Apple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C)","1":"Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro, Apple's upcoming wearable headset that's set to be released in early 2024 and costs $3,499. Is it possible that new acoustic architecture makes the buds sound subtly different with current devices like the iPhone? Maybe, maybe not.

That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads.The HX have custom 40mm drivers, Bluetooth 5.1 and support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive (that includes AptX HD) for high-resolution wireless streaming when you combine an aptX-enabled Android device with certain music-streaming services like Qobuz.Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound, overall well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. If you want to push the treble or bass, you can tweak the EQ in the Bang & Olufsen app for iOS and Android and give the headphones a warmer or brighter profile. Their noise canceling is also very good and voice-calling capabilities are also quite solid. Additionally, they offer multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them with a smartphone and PC simultaneously (Microsoft Swift Pair-enabled for Windows machines) so you can easily switch between the two. Battery life is rated at up to 35 hours with noise canceling on and 40 hours with it off.Earlier Bang & Olufsen models included a soft case (a pouch really), but the HX headphones come with a hard case. As I said, they're expensive, but the small improvements over earlier flagship Bang & Olufsen noise-canceling headphones help make the HX headphones a worthy alternative to the AirPods Max.","3":"311","4":"0.995","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,2.392451215615271,0,1.0500205175158943,4.476920235274207,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,0,1.4726387048503082,3.1254685865746485,1.7973546927350068,6.0401859137070835,1.8255515795334214,0.5014797613477531,0,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,1.9596757557867082,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.64219613874325,3.9547226936246247,0,1.7591376154027176,0,1.539527403332833,5.738004229273791,2.298329135661882,0.9056001223312122,2.04800284975387,1.875281151944789,7.032958089350611,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,1.0438040521731147,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0,3.7267649726908587,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0,0.9493127452246646,0.7073318155519017,0,1.2240432714951537,1.4354707293691626,1.4726387048503082,0.6653676164528696,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.3114361584598881,0,2.0626613766562842,1.2240432714951537,0,1.3862943611198906,1.6078006640028795,0,0.11954515064978273,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0,4.596658271323764,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,0.40195016600071987,2.5658790055547214,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,2.438076993629184,2.3443193631168704,2.980182309603068,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,1.6253846624194561,0.7214144149333415,0,0,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,1.1476008458547582,0,4.754126570096438]},"index":19},{"0":"Baseus Bowie MA10","1":"Priced at just $28 after you click an instant 20% discount coupon on Amazon, the Baseus Bowie MA10 delivers surprisingly good sound along with active noise canceling for its low price (you just don't see too many active noise canceling earbuds at this price).

The new DT 700 X is easier to drive than the 770 Pro, thanks to the company's new STELLAR.45 sound transducer with an impedance of 48 ohms, so it plays better with smartphones, tablets and laptops without requiring a headphone amp.The headphone is targeted at content creators who want accurate audio reproduction, but it's a bit more dynamic sounding and less bass-shy than many studio headphones, which tend to restrain the bass and hew toward a very neutral sound profile. The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in. This closed-back version is more versatile.","3":"247","4":"0.9423","5":{"type":1,"values":[2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,3.8279219449844337,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,1.875281151944789,1.1982364618233379,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,1.4015720636073625,0.9798378778933541,2.3908319227247667,1.2669476034873244,1.605490346858125,0,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0,5.219020260865573,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,2.2248377554220538,1.0213867672353782,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0,0.4340384805522204,0,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.5571807922994405,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0,2.772588722239781,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.7172709038986964,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.1716374236829996,1.8112002446624245,0,1.7591376154027176,2.16925209338674,0.40195016600071987,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,0,1.703532703800006,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,2.2534033146308836,0.36070720746667073,2.2952016917095164,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"index":26},{"0":"Beyerdynamic Xelento Wireless (2nd Generation)","1":"If you're willing to spend a lot of money, Beyerdynamic's 2nd-Generation Xelento Wireless earbuds deliver fantastic sound quality.

The concept is that you're getting a decent pair of sunglasses with a pair of headphones that don't actually go in your ears. Rather, integrated micro speakers in each arm direct a beam of sound to your ears. That design could be appealing to people who don't like having headphones in or on their ears and also offers a degree of safety for runners and bikers who want their ears open to the world.Bose has updated its line of audio sunglasses with three new models, including the Tempo sports model, which offers better sound and battery life than the more traditional-looking Tenor and Soprano. The Tempo has better specs all around, with USB-C charging and larger 22mm drivers. It also delivers up to 8 hours of battery life.Their sound is definitely improved from the original Frames. Bose says the Tempo plays \"deeper and louder -- loud enough for cycling at 25 mph -- while [you're] still able to hear traffic and your training partners.\" They're sweat-, weather-, scratch- and shatter-resistant, according to Bose, and fit under most protective helmets. (I had no problem using them with a couple of bike helmets.) They also work really well for making calls, thanks to a new dual-microphone system. Optional lenses are available for $39 and you can order prescription lenses through Lensabl.","3":"238","4":"0.9673","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,0,0,2.3964729236466757,1.0982156206740152,1.8255515795334214,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.321098069371625,1.318240897874875,2.886882212016005,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,1.539527403332833,0,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.9056001223312122,2.1219954466557054,0,0.4449675510844107,2.0427735344707565,1.6573853451123386,0,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,4.243990893311411,1.7361539222088815,0,0,0,0,0.7661723155748351,1.469756816840031,0.6228723169197762,0,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,2.0794415416798357,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,0,0,1.0045833390198333,0,0,0,0,1.318240897874875,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,1.2058504980021596,1.539527403332833,0,0,0,4.0634616560486405,0.7814397877056235,2.980182309603068,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0,1.6253846624194561,0.36070720746667073,0,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,0]},"index":28},{"0":"Bose QuietComfort 45","1":"The QuietComfort 45 has virtually the same design as its predecessor, the QuietComfort QC35 II, which many people consider one of the most comfortable over-ear headphones -- if not the most comfortable. It has the same drivers, and the buttons are in the same place. There are small but notable changes. First, we're pleased that these have a USB-C charging port instead of Micro-USB. Secondly, the microphone configuration is different. Not only have the mics been shifted, but there's now an additional external microphone for voice pick-up, which means the QC45 has a total of six mics, four of which are beamforming and used for voice. By contrast, the QC35 II has four, two of which are used for voice. (The Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 also have six microphones total.)These headphones are excellent for making calls. They're similar to the Bose Headphones 700 in that regard. They also include top-notch noise canceling and multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can connect them with a PC and your phone simultaneously. Read our full review of the QuietComfort 45.","3":"173","4":"0.9259","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,2.3359534393456043,0,0,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,0,1.9336860220739729,0,1.875281151944789,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,1.5044392840432592,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.4671906878691208,0,0.7969439742415889,0,0.963294208114875,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,0.5106933836176891,0,0,1.131992892557418,0,0,0.9493127452246646,1.4146636311038034,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0,0,0,0,0,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0,0.6931471805599453,0,0,0.23909030129956546,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0,1.0029595226955061,0,0,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,1.562879575411247,0,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0,0,0.6326847877140319,0,0,0,0,1.7214012687821372,0,0]},"index":29},{"0":"Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2","1":"Bose's second-generation QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are not only about 30% smaller than their predecessors, but their case is about 40% smaller and truly pocketable.

Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the very comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations and that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). The QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling, and strong voice-calling performance.  As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \"visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \"help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com. While the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than over the course of the year -- so look to buy them when they're on sale. You can read our review of the QuietComfort 45 to get a good take on the QuietComfort Headphones.","3":"283","4":"0.9843","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0,0.5250102587579472,0,1.362826163040005,3.8673720441479458,2.9566054321474167,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,2.1964312413480305,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,1.4015720636073625,0,1.5938879484831778,0,1.92658841622975,1.318240897874875,0,1.7591376154027176,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0,0.9855351440491389,6.876030890464227,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.4449675510844107,1.2767334590442228,3.314770690224677,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,1.1727584102684785,0.9493127452246646,2.1219954466557054,1.7361539222088815,3.060108178737884,0.4784902431230542,2.9452774097006165,1.3307352329057391,0,1.9596757557867082,1.2457446338395524,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0,0.8489946694180636,1.0045833390198333,0,0,1.1716374236829996,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.539527403332833,3.072004274630805,2.3443193631168704,0,1.6253846624194561,0.7814397877056235,0,1.703532703800006,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0.36070720746667073,0,1.562879575411247,1.0544746461900532,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"index":31},{"0":"Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds","1":"While the QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're definitely a little better.

I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. The PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers excellent sound.

When they finally hit stores, the PX8's price jumped to $699 or a full $300 more than the company's step-down PX7 S2 headphones, which are also excellent (see below).The biggest difference between the PX8, which weigh in at 320 grams, and the PX7 S2 are the PX8's all-new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are \"inspired\" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 Series loudspeaker line. Bowers & Wilkins says these units help deliver superior resolution, detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the PX7 S2.Based on my tests, that's true. While I liked the PX7 S2, the PX8 headphones do sound more special, with a touch more openness and overall clarity. They're right near the top for sound in Bluetooth headphones and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions (there's no listening fatigue with these guys). For the best sound, you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USB-C to USB-C cable. As for the noise-canceling function, it's good but not quite on par with what you get from Sony's WH-1000XM5. And while the voice-calling capabilities are solid, these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls (the transparency mode is top-notch). While I can't say they're worth $300 more than the PX7 S2, they're a great set of cans if you can afford them. I do prefer the sound and overall performance of the more expensive Focal Bathys, though the Bathys don't have such strong noise canceling, but the PX8 headphones are a close second.","3":"295","4":"0.9757","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.6250937173149297,0,2.745539051685038,0,2.0059190453910123,2.84548161710637,0.6931471805599453,1.8687627514764833,0,0.7969439742415889,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,1.7591376154027176,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,2.2952016917095164,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,6.14400854926161,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0,1.875281151944789,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,3.314770690224677,0,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,0,0.9493127452246646,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,1.303523928794182,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,3.4657359027997265,2.0097508300035996,0.6791609385852054,0.7172709038986964,0,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.6037334148874748,1.318240897874875,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,0,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,0,1.0221196222800037,3.125759150822494,0.9484938723687899,3.2507693248389122,0.36070720746667073,3.4428025375642743,1.562879575411247,0.6326847877140319,1.3583218771704109,0,3.755672191051473,0,1.7214012687821372,1.6841337087864658,0]},"index":37},{"0":"Cleer Audio Arc 2 Sport","1":"Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. This new-for-2023 model steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new \"enhanced\" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which makes for a significantly improved product.Cleer says the Arc 2 Sport buds feature \"greater flexibility for improved comfort,\" and I did find them more comfortable to wear than the original Arcs. That said, not everyone loves this style of open earbuds, which lets sound in so you can hear ambient sound around you for safety purposes.With a new six-axis motion sensor, you can actually control the buds with head gestures -- you answer calls by nodding and skip tracks forward by turning your head to the right and skip a track back by turning your head left. Thankfully, those motion controls can be turned off if you don't want to use them. These are among the first buds to support Qualcomm's aptX Lossless format, if you're one of the few to have an Android device that supports that audio codec (plenty of Android phones support aptX Adaptive). Since these aren't high-end noise-isolating earbuds, you probably won't be able to tell the difference in sound quality -- I couldn't -- but all that aside, these do sound very good for open-style earbuds. They lack a bit of oomph to their bass but they're punchy enough, offer good clarity and didn't distort at higher volumes. They also played sufficiently loud. They have an IPX5 water- and sweat-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water, and battery life is very good at up to eight hours on a single charge, plus there's a little more than three additional charges in the slim but still somewhat bulky charging case. It's big compared to an AirPods charging case, but svelte compared to other cases that house this style of earbuds.These offer respectable performance for voice calls, but callers did say they heard a certain amount of white noise when I spoke to them from the noisy streets of New York -- that whooshing sound is the by-product of the earbuds' noise-reduction efforts.","3":"379","4":"0.9883","5":{"type":1,"values":[2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,2.2534033146308836,0,0,1.0221196222800037,0,1.9710702880982778,1.875281151944789,2.2089580572754626,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,0.5491078103370076,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0,1.2669476034873244,0.64219613874325,0,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,1.1476008458547582,0,0.9056001223312122,1.024001424876935,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,1.122755805857644,1.509333537218687,2.0876081043462293,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,1.8112002446624245,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,1.7798702043376429,1.5320801508530675,0,3.8673720441479458,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,0.5863792051342392,1.1866409315308308,2.1219954466557054,2.6042308833133223,1.8360649072427306,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,1.2457446338395524,1.303523928794182,2.0626613766562842,0,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,1.31499665714761,0,1.131992892557418,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,2.113066952106162,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,3.079054806665666,2.04800284975387,0,0.5014797613477531,3.2507693248389122,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.703532703800006,3.125759150822494,1.8969877447375798,0.8126923312097281,1.8035360373333535,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.8435797169520426,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0,2.5249504522666952,2.2952016917095164,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"index":38},{"0":"Creative Sound Blaster Jam V2","1":"I was a fan of Creative's original Sound Blaster Jam headphones that came out in 2015 and had a decidedly retro look and feel, with good sound for the money.

Battery life is rated at up to 22 hours.I was able to pair this wireless headphone set with a Mac Mini and an iPhone 12 Pro and then switch audio between them. Often when pairing Bluetooth headphones with Mac and Windows PCs, one can encounter some issues, but once I got the headphones paired with both my PC and phone, they made a good pair of work-from-home headphones. Also, the price is right for parents looking for a decent set of kids' headphones for remote learning and everyday use.Comfortable for on-ear headphones, the Jam V2s are lightweight and have nicely balanced sound with good detail and bass that's ample but not overpowering. Call quality was good in my tests with callers saying they could hear me well even on the noisy streets of New York. No carry pouch is included, but you do get an extra set of foam ear pads, which is good, because they will wear out over time.The headphones have physical buttons for controlling volume and playback, and there's aptX support for devices that support the wireless streaming codec.","3":"244","4":"0.9841","5":{"type":1,"values":[2.3964729236466757,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,2.2089580572754626,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,2.1964312413480305,0.9127757897667107,1.5044392840432592,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,1.4015720636073625,0,0,0,0,0,1.4434411060080026,1.1727584102684785,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,0.5738004229273791,5.745822839154705,0.6037334148874748,1.024001424876935,2.5003748692597187,0,1.6841337087864658,0.9056001223312122,0,0,1.875281151944789,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,2.2248377554220538,0.5106933836176891,1.6573853451123386,0,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0,0.23732818630616614,0,0.4340384805522204,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0,1.9596757557867082,0,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0,0,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,1.3583218771704109,0.3586354519493482,0,1.131992892557418,0,0,1.149164567830941,2.3432748473659992,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,3.0088785680865184,0.8126923312097281,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0.5738004229273791,1.562879575411247,0,1.3583218771704109,1.3021154416566612,1.5022688764205891,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,1.6841337087864658,1.3583218771704109]},"index":39},{"0":"Cyber Acoustics Essential Bluetooth Headset HS-2000BT","1":"UC headsets that include a USB dongle so you can easily connect the headset wirelessly to your computer tend to cost more than headsets that just feature Bluetooth connectivity.

I'm not going to say the HS-2000BT is better than those models, but it's lightweight and comfortable to wear and offers similar features, including a retractable boom microphone with automatic muting (when you retract the boom mic). It also has a couple of bonus features: active noise canceling and wireless charging (Qi wireless charging pad not included). Callers said I sounded good though not quite as clear as when I was using the Logitech Zone Vibe 100.

They have slightly larger wool-composite drivers (11mm versus 10mm), slightly improved noise canceling and better battery life (up to seven hours with noise canceling on, according to Earfun).In short, the Earfun Air 3 deliver strong performance for their modest price, with robust bass, good clarity and a relatively wide soundstage. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and \"multidevice\" connectivity. (I could pair them to two devices simultaneously but had to pause the music on one device and hit play on the other for the audio to switch.) They're IPX5 splash-proof and also work well (though not exceptionally well) as a headset for making calls. Use the code EAP3CNET at checkout at Amazon to drop the price to just less than $55.","3":"227","4":"0.9919","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,1.8687627514764833,0.9569804862461084,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0,0,0,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.64219613874325,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0,1.539527403332833,2.2952016917095164,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,0,0.6250937173149297,3.125759150822494,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.5106933836176891,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,1.4146636311038034,2.6042308833133223,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,0,0,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,0.8039003320014397,0,0,1.9336860220739729,1.131992892557418,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.9056001223312122,1.318240897874875,0,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,0,2.5073988067387654,1.6253846624194561,0,1.490091154801534,0,0,0.9484938723687899,2.438076993629184,1.442828829866683,0,0,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,1.7361539222088815,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"index":41},{"0":"Earfun Air S","1":"In the past, we've recommended Earfun's AirPro SV and  as excellent budget noise-canceling earbuds choices (they're still good values).

The first thing you'll notice about them when you put them on is that they're comfortable. Edifier has upgraded the ear pads with higher-grade memory foam, and the headphones fit snugly on your head. They also sound pretty good for their price, offering slightly improved audio quality from the originals, thanks to what appear to be upgraded drivers (also, they now support the LDAC audio codec for Android devices). You get a bit more clarity and a slightly better bass definition. Their sound didn't necessarily blow me away -- they lack a bit of openness -- but it's very good for what the headphones cost. Like their predecessor, they're pleasant-sounding headphones  (even a bit more so now). Other features include an ambient mode that lets outside sound in and a low-latency gaming mode. The noise canceling has been upgraded slightly, and they're decent for voice calling. Battery life is pretty impressive, with up to 49 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels (and noise canceling off). A couple of things are still missing: There's no carrying case or headphone jack, although it can connect them to your computer with the included USB-C to USB-A cable.

A couple of features were missing at launch -- spatial audio and a five-band equalizer -- but both have now been added with firmware updates.","2":"8.4","3":"113","4":"0.7845","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0.64219613874325,0,0,0,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0438040521731147,0,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0,0,0,1.0213867672353782,0,0,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,0,0.651761964397091,0,0.6120216357475768,0,0,0.40195016600071987,0,0.11954515064978273,0.9668430110369864,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0,1.024001424876935,0,0,0,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0.7214144149333415,0,0,0,0,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,2.245511611715288,1.3583218771704109]},"index":48},{"0":"HyperX Cloud Stinger Core","1":"As far as basic wired gaming headsets go, you can't go wrong with the HyperX's Cloud Stinger Core.

Just be aware that if you don't get a tight seal, sound quality will be significantly worse. Also, like other earbuds with ear-hook designs, the case is on the beefy side.

It also works with other game consoles and is pretty decent for music, though it's a touch bright. While some of JBL's higher-end models feature wireless connectivity and even noise canceling, the Quantum 100 is just a basic gaming headphone that will appeal to more casual gamers on a tight budget.","3":"110","4":"0.9761","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0.9569804862461084,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,1.9596757557867082,1.5938879484831778,0,0.64219613874325,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0,1.149164567830941,0,0,0,2.3443193631168704,0,0,0,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0.7073318155519017,0,0.4449675510844107,0,0,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0,0,0,0,0,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,0.8039003320014397,0,0.23909030129956546,0,0,2.0091666780396666,0,2.298329135661882,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0.8126923312097281,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6326847877140319,0,0,0.7511344382102946,0,0,0,1.3583218771704109]},"index":55},{"0":"JBL Tune 670NC","1":"The JBL Live 670NC is one of a relatively small number of on-ear headphones to offer active noise canceling.

There is no companion app so you can't update the firmware.","3":"114","4":"0.9465","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,0,0,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0.9127757897667107,0,0,0,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0.963294208114875,0,0.7217205530040013,1.7591376154027176,0,0,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.3018667074437374,2.0876081043462293,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0.7073318155519017,0,0.4449675510844107,0,0,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0,0.7119845589184984,0,0,0.6120216357475768,0,0.7363193524251541,0,1.5323446311496702,0,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0,0,0,0,0.4781806025991309,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0,1.562879575411247,0,1.0221196222800037,0,0,0,0.7214144149333415,0,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0,0.4340384805522204,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,0,0]},"index":61},{"0":"JVC Flats","1":"While the JVC Flats may not be terribly durable, you'll be hard pressed to find a better sounding set of on-ear headphones at the price.

While this is an on-ear headset, it has a nicely padded headband and earpieces and is impressively comfortable (it also helps that it's relatively lightweight, weighing 136 grams or 4.8 ounces).I was impressed with the sound and performance of the Evolve2 65 Flex. It has a retractable boom microphone and good active noise canceling along with excellent noise reduction for calls (I made calls in the noisy streets of New York and callers said I sounded clear with little background noise intrusion). Flip the boom mic up and you automatically get muted during video conference calls; flip it down and you unmute yourself.With 28mm drivers, this headset also works well for listening to music and other audio, which is what you should expect for its high price tag. However, it only supports the SBC audio codec and not the superior AAC or aptX audio codecs (that's not the end of the world, but it is worth pointing out). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, you can connect it to a variety of devices wirelessly and the included Bluetooth USB-A dongle allows for easy pairing with PCs (you can connect it to two devices at the same time). Finally, battery life is rated at up to 21 hours with noise-canceling on and 32 hours with it off. That's decent for a compact headset.","3":"255","4":"0.9618","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,1.9139609724922169,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0,1.4726387048503082,3.1254685865746485,1.1982364618233379,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0,1.5938879484831778,0,1.605490346858125,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,1.1476008458547582,0,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,0.6250937173149297,3.125759150822494,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,0,0,0,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,0,0,0.4746563726123323,1.4146636311038034,1.3021154416566612,1.2240432714951537,2.392451215615271,0,0,0,1.469756816840031,0,0,1.2375968259937706,2.4480865429903074,0.7073318155519017,2.0794415416798357,1.6078006640028795,2.037482815755616,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,1.0045833390198333,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.6037334148874748,1.318240897874875,0,0,0.8039003320014397,2.5658790055547214,1.024001424876935,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0,1.362826163040005,1.562879575411247,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.4217898584760213,0,1.7361539222088815,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,1.122755805857644,0]},"index":69},{"0":"Jabra Evolve2 85 UC","1":"If you're looking for a souped-up version of Jabra's Elite 85h headphones, which came out a few years ago, the Evolve2 85 offers even better telephony options along with a Unified Communications USB dongle for PCs.

The Logi Tune app for iOS and Android does allow you to tweak the sound profile, adjust the sidetone and set when the headset goes to sleep when not in use.","3":"207","4":"0.8812","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.7973546927350068,0.4671906878691208,0.9569804862461084,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,1.362826163040005,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.875281151944789,1.7973546927350068,1.0982156206740152,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0.9343813757382416,0,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.963294208114875,1.318240897874875,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,1.2074668297749496,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.561377902928822,1.2074668297749496,0,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0.7073318155519017,0,0.8899351021688214,0.7660400754265337,0,0,0.565996446278709,0,0,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,1.3021154416566612,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0,1.3307352329057391,1.5323446311496702,0,0.6228723169197762,0,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.23909030129956546,0,0.565996446278709,2.0091666780396666,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,1.0263516022218886,0,0,1.0029595226955061,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0,1.562879575411247,0.4217898584760213,0,0.8680769611044408,1.5022688764205891,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"index":73},{"0":"Logitech Zone Wireless 2","1":"Logitech's second-gen Zone Wireless 2 headset improves on the original with an upgraded design and performance. This is an on-ear model that competes with Jabra's Evolve2 65 Flex but is a bit heavier (230 grams) and has some metal parts (the headset feels both substantial and sturdy with a premium look). It is comfortable to wear for long periods with soft ear pads filled with high-quality memory foam. Like the Jabra, this Logitech has a retractable boom microphone with a mute button on it. It also has active noise cancellation and I thought it did a good job muffling external noise and reducing background noise when I was on calls. You can also toggle on a transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world. The headset is equipped with five microphones and uses Bluetooth 5.2 with a wireless range of 50 meters, which is much better than the typical 10-meter range of Bluetooth. Battery life is rated at up to 15 hours with noise canceling on and 18 hours with it off.People were impressed by how clear I sounded on calls, even when I tested the headset in the noisy streets of New York. Sound quality has also improved, and while this doesn't sound as good as Sony or Bose headphones, the sound quality for listening to music is quite respectable. It support the SBC, AAC and AptX audio codecs (Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex only supports SBC).The white version I tried was Microsoft Teams certified and came with a USB-A/USB-C Bluetooth dongle for computer use and a slim carry pouch. In all, this is a nice upgrade over Logitech's Zone Wireless Headset and a top headset.","3":"276","4":"0.9952","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.9343813757382416,2.8709414587383253,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,2.0442392445600075,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0.7363193524251541,2.5003748692597187,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,1.8255515795334214,0,0,1.3862943611198906,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,0.7969439742415889,0,2.247686485601375,2.63648179574975,2.165161659012004,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,1.2074668297749496,0,0,1.562879575411247,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,0.4449675510844107,1.0213867672353782,0,0,1.4149911156967727,1.6253846624194561,0,0.4746563726123323,2.1219954466557054,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.469756816840031,0.9343084753796642,0,0.41253227533125686,1.8360649072427306,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,2.037482815755616,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0,1.875281151944789,0,0,0,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,2.0059190453910123,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.362826163040005,1.562879575411247,1.8969877447375798,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,0,1.0544746461900532,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"index":74},{"0":"Mark Levinson No. 5909","1":"The No. 5909 are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones. Yes, they're expensive at $999 and probably a wee bit overpriced, but they're excellent. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial, but not heavy) and they're comfortable to wear over long periods thanks to their nicely padded (and replaceable) leather-covered earcups and headbands.Not only do they have good noise canceling and excellent sound, but their voice-calling performance is top-notch, making them one of the best noise-canceling headphones options on the market. Plus, they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices, such as a computer and a phone, simultaneously.The No. 5909 are high-res certified with support for Sony's LDAC and Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive codecs that allow for near-lossless streaming over Bluetooth. Apple's iPhones and iPads don't support those codecs while certain Android devices do. Using the No. 5909 headphones over Bluetooth on my iPhone 13 Pro, it sounded a tad more natural and refined than the AirPods Max (the No. 5909 had a touch more \"pure\" and accurate sound).I did notice a difference when I paired the No. 5909 to my Google Pixel 4 XL, which has support for LDAC, and using the Qobuz audio streaming service that offers high-res streaming. Overall, the sound had a little more depth and texture, and there's a touch more sparkle, definition and openness.","3":"230","4":"0.9948","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,5.372304282329048,0.34070654076000123,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.5991182309116689,2.1964312413480305,0,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0.64219613874325,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,1.7214012687821372,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,0,1.2501874346298594,1.562879575411247,0,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,0.7073318155519017,0,0,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,0,1.1866409315308308,0,2.170192402761102,0,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,1.3862943611198906,1.2058504980021596,0,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,3.1254685865746485,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,1.362826163040005,0,0,3.2507693248389122,0.7214144149333415,1.7214012687821372,0,0,1.3583218771704109,0,2.2534033146308836,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"index":75},{"0":"Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd Generation)","1":"All of Master & Dynamic's headphones are well built (they're sturdy) and have a unique retro-modern look.

Its latest MW09 flagship earbuds look pretty similar to its earlier MW08 buds but have some upgrades on the inside that deliver better performance, particularly when it comes to noise canceling (it's now very close to what Bose and Sony offer, though not quite at their level for ANC) and battery life. They're IP54 dust-proof and splash-proof and despite being on the larger side, I found them comfortable to wear, and they stayed in my ears fairly securely.If you can get a tight seal (seven ear tips are included), the MW09s sound great. They sound natural with nice detail and deep bass that is well defined and not overpowering. A touch on the warmer side -- there's no treble push -- with an open, refined quality, they're earbuds you can listening to for long stretches without any listening fatigue. They're right up there with the best-sounding buds.Other highlights include the aforementioned very strong battery life (up to 16 hours), Bluetooth 5.4 (up to 30-meter range and LE Audio ready) and multipoint Bluetooth pairing.

Its latest MW09 flagship earbuds look pretty similar to its earlier MW08 buds but have some upgrades on the inside that deliver better performance, particularly when it comes to noise canceling (it's now very close to what Bose and Sony offer though not quite at their level for ANC) and battery life. They're IP54 dust-proof and splash-proof and despite being on the larger side, I found them comfortable to wear and they stayed in my ears fairly securely. If you can get a tight seal (seven ear tips are included), the MW09s sound great. They sound natural with nice detail and deep bass that is well-defined and not overpowering. A touch on the warmer side -- there's no treble push -- with an open, refined quality, they're earbuds you can listen to for long stretches without any listening fatigue. They're right up there with the best-sounding buds. Other highlights include the aforementioned very strong battery life (up to 16 hours), Bluetooth 5.4 (up to 30m range and LE Audio ready) and multipoint Bluetooth pairing.

The MW75's build quality is hard to beat and they offer top-notch sound for a wireless model (I thought they sounded better than Apple's AirPods Max headphones), plus strong voice-calling and noise-canceling performance.

Voice-calling performance was also above average with decent though not fantastic noise reduction on the streets of New York.

Oraimo's Open Ear Headphones look like a bone-conduction model but instead have speakers built into them that fire sound into your ears. That sound is better than what you get with bone-conduction headphones (it's bigger with better bass performance). I wouldn't say they sound quite as good as decent noise-isolating earbuds, but the sound is quite respectable and has a nice open quality to it because these are after all \"open\" headphones.The Oraimo is more expensive than some similarly styled open-ear headphones you can find on Amazon. But these did seem durable and also are good for making calls, with solid background noise reduction. This style of headphones isn't for everyone (some may find them slightly uncomfortable after longer listening sessions), but they do stay on your ears securely and allow you to hear the outside world for safety reasons. Battery life is rated at 16 hours at moderate volume levels and they're splashproof.","3":"180","4":"0.984","5":{"type":1,"values":[2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,0,2.2089580572754626,1.2501874346298594,0,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,0.6931471805599453,0,0,0,2.5338952069746488,0,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,0.5738004229273791,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.5106933836176891,0,0,0.565996446278709,0,0,0.23732818630616614,1.4146636311038034,0,0.6120216357475768,0,0,0,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0,0,0.5977257532489136,0,0.8489946694180636,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0.8126923312097281,1.562879575411247,0,0,2.3443193631168704,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0,1.0821216224000123,0,0.561377902928822,0]},"index":82},{"0":"Panasonic RP-HJE120","1":"Panasonic's ErgoFit RP-HJE120 in-ear headphones, which come in multiple colors and retail for less than $10, sound remarkably good for the money.

Now we get the Voyager Focus 2 UC from Poly (the company Plantronics morphed into after it acquired Polycom), and it's improved in several ways, including better noise reduction (it's stellar), two levels of active noise canceling, increased battery life (up to 19 hours with ANC off and 16 hours with it on) and superior wireless range with Bluetooth 5.1. You can pair the Voyager Focus 2 UC with your computer with the included USB dongle or your phone (or tablet) via Bluetooth. It can also connect to a desk phone if you want to bring it to the office. Also worth noting: The boom microphone has a mute button on it, but when you flip it up it also automatically mutes the microphone. The original Voyager Focus doesn't mute when you lift the boom microphone.The Focus 2 comes in several different versions, including USB-A and USB-C models and a version that's Microsoft Teams certified. You can get the headset by itself or in a bundle that includes a charging dock. All versions include a nice protective carrying pouch.The Voyager Focus 2 UC is expensive but offers excellent performance and is quite comfortable for an on-ear headphone. It also sounds good for music listening with nicely detailed sound and ample bass. It may not be quite up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 for music, but it offers a nice music listening experience for a work-centric headset.Pros:Lightweight and comfortable to wearStellar noise reduction for callsRetractable boom microphone with mute buttonDecent noise canceling and sound qualityUSB wireless adapter included for PCsCons:Version with USB-C wireless dongle is more expensive","3":"282","4":"0.9929","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.4671906878691208,0.9569804862461084,0,0.5250102587579472,3.5815361882193653,1.362826163040005,0.9668430110369864,0,0,2.2089580572754626,3.1254685865746485,1.7973546927350068,0,0,1.0029595226955061,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.92658841622975,2.63648179574975,1.4434411060080026,1.1727584102684785,2.9452774097006165,1.0263516022218886,2.2952016917095164,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,6.14400854926161,0,1.562879575411247,2.245511611715288,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0,1.4146636311038034,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.25534669180884456,0,0,1.4149911156967727,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,0,1.3021154416566612,1.8360649072427306,0.9569804862461084,0,0,1.5323446311496702,0.9798378778933541,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0.7073318155519017,2.772588722239781,0,2.037482815755616,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,2.5003748692597187,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.08462604669337,2.813651162005039,2.052703204443777,1.024001424876935,3.125759150822494,3.0088785680865184,4.0634616560486405,1.562879575411247,0,0.34070654076000123,1.562879575411247,0,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.6871594339040852,1.3583218771704109,1.7361539222088815,0,0,0,0,1.3583218771704109]},"index":84},{"0":"Poly Voyager Free 60 Plus UC","1":"Like JBL's Tour Pro 2 earbuds, the Poly Voyager Free 60 Plus UC earbuds also have a touchscreen display embedded in their charging case. The display isn't quite as fancy as the one on the JBL case (it's mostly monochrome), but these are among the first earbuds to have a case with a mini control panel integrated into it. Additionally, the Free 60 Plus UC case also turns into a Bluetooth transceiver for inflight entertainment systems (you plug the case into the 3.5mm headphone port). I also liked how you can store the USB-A Bluetooth dongle in the charging case when you're not using it with your computer. Aside from the tricked out case, the bigl strengths of the Poly Voyager Free 60 are their comfortable fit, excellent voice-calling performance for video calls (they have three-mic array in each bud), solid noice canceling and very good sound quality. Equipped with 10mm drivers, they might not offer quite as good sound quality for music as other premium earbuds in this price range, but there's good depth and punch to the bass, decent clarity and they have a pleasant sound profile overall. They support the AAC and AptX audio codecs as well as LC3 when making video calls, Poly says. Battery life is rated at up to 5.5 hours with noise canceling on. I was able to easily switch between using the buds with my computer (with the USB dongle) and my iPhone. While they worked well for making cell-phone calls indoors and outdoors in quieter environments, callers said they could hear a good amount of background noise when I was making calls in noisier environments. Poly says it's working to improve noise reduction for cell-phone calls with a firmware update later this year. The earbuds can be updated via the Poly Lens app for Desktop, iOS or Android that also features a variety of settings you can play around with.Note that these earbuds are available in a non-UC version with a standard charging case for $230 or $100 less.","3":"336","4":"0.9978","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,1.2501874346298594,1.4726387048503082,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,1.9596757557867082,1.5938879484831778,0,0.963294208114875,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0,1.149164567830941,1.2074668297749496,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,0,0,3.5597404086752857,0.25534669180884456,0,0,1.131992892557418,1.6253846624194561,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,2.1219954466557054,3.0382693638655427,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0,2.6614704658114783,1.5323446311496702,2.939513633680062,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,2.4751936519875413,2.4480865429903074,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,2.411700996004319,0,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,1.6979893388361271,2.0091666780396666,1.875281151944789,0,0,2.113066952106162,2.63648179574975,1.7591376154027176,1.08462604669337,1.2058504980021596,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,0.34070654076000123,1.562879575411247,0.9484938723687899,1.6253846624194561,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,1.2653695754280638,4.754126570096438,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,2.8068895146441095,0.6791609385852054]},"index":85},{"0":"Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One (Currently: Unavailable)","1":"The Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox is a beast of wireless headset, at least in terms of size.

The ear pads are equipped with cooling gel-infused cushions, and the Razer logo lights up.Aside from excellent sound quality and comfort, the other signature feature is the built-in HyperSense haptic feedback technology that lets you feel the game while you're playing.

It's 6 hours with HyperSense on and 20 hours with it turned off.It's worth pointing out that this is an open-back headset, which does help open up the soundstage and give the audio a more airy quality, but the sound will leak out of the headphones, which could annoy others around you.

In fact, it's the Buds 2's design and fit -- they're 15% smaller and 20% lighter than the Buds Plus -- that make them a potentially more likable alternative to the slightly better-sounding Buds Pro. Like the Buds Pro, the Buds 2 are equipped with active noise canceling. That means all the latest Galaxy Buds models now feature some form of active noise canceling, though it's slight with the Buds Live, which have an open design sans ear tips. While the Buds 2 look more like shrunken versions of the Buds Pro, I found them more akin to the Buds Live in that they barely stick out of your ears and are fairly discreet. Because they sit more flush with your ears -- and have that curved design -- they also pick up less wind noise. I found the Buds 2 to be very good for voice calling, with excellent noise reduction during calls. While they don't have pipes sticking out of them like the AirPods Pro, their microphones manage to pick up your voice well. They're IPX2 sweat-resistant.","2":"8.2","3":"216","4":"0.9719","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.9343813757382416,0,0,1.0500205175158943,0,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.2501874346298594,0,1.0982156206740152,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,0,2.5338952069746488,1.605490346858125,2.63648179574975,0,1.1727584102684785,0,0,0,0,1.2074668297749496,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,1.509333537218687,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,0.8899351021688214,4.340893760750357,3.314770690224677,0,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0,0.4340384805522204,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,1.5571807922994405,0,0.8250645506625137,1.2240432714951537,0,0,0.40195016600071987,0,0,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0,2.298329135661882,2.3432748473659992,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,0,1.2058504980021596,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0,1.562879575411247,0,1.0221196222800037,0,0,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,1.0544746461900532,3.3958046929260273,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0,0,0.561377902928822,1.3583218771704109]},"index":87},{"0":"Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro","1":"The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer improved noise canceling along with very good sound and voice-calling performance, plus support for high-resolution wireless audio streaming if you're a Galaxy device owner with the right setup.

But they do offer respectable sound quality (it's certainly as good as the Galaxy Buds 2's) and decent noise canceling. I also found them to be lightweight and comfortable to wear.

This leads to better sound, with the bass adding more depth and definition, while the treble gains a bit more clarity and sizzle (the very natural-sounding mids remain pretty much unchanged as far as I can tell). The soundstage also seems more spacious and airy -- yes, these are open-back headphones so they do leak sound.Note that the 660S2 require some extra power to drive (they're now 300-ohm headphones), so you'll want to pair them with a dedicated headphone amplifier. I did manage to use them with an iPhone, by plugging them into an AudioQuest Dragonfly USB DAC/Amp (there's also a version for Android smartphones). They sounded great listening to high-resolution tracks from Qobuz, the music streaming service.Audiophile headphones usually have a very neutral sound profile, but the 660S2 don't suffer from being overly so. They mix in just enough excitement while also managing to sound really clean and smooth. They're also comfortable, though some people with larger heads have complained that they feel a bit too tight on their heads.

For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors.The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, as well as the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that \"assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste.\" Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers \"best-in-class\" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.","3":"229","4":"0.9879","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.362826163040005,0,1.9710702880982778,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0,1.0982156206740152,0,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,0,0.64219613874325,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0,0.7363193524251541,0,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,2.113066952106162,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,3.1314121565193442,0,1.2501874346298594,1.8112002446624245,4.243990893311411,0,0,0.7660400754265337,0,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6653676164528696,0,1.469756816840031,0,0.651761964397091,3.300258202650055,0,0.7073318155519017,2.772588722239781,1.2058504980021596,1.3583218771704109,0.8368160545484791,0,0,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,3.5103583294342715,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0,1.703532703800006,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"index":92},{"0":"Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3","1":"Featuring excellent sound, improved noise canceling and voice-calling, and a smaller, more refined design, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 was among the best new true-wireless earbuds of 2022.

The second-generation OpenComm 2 UC costs more than the original, but it has an upgraded Bluetooth 5.1 chipset that improves performance a bit and now allows for the firmware upgrades that are required for Zoom certification. Additionally, the microphone has moved from the left ear to the right and a convenient mute button has been added to the boom microphone -- an important addition. Since these leave your ears open -- the sound is conducted through your cheekbone -- they aren't for people who want to seal their ears out from outside noise. Rather, the idea is that you can hear everything around you without having anything covering your ears or jammed inside them. The headset is quite comfortable to wear. Some folks find that liberating and these do feature excellent noise reduction for calls, as callers told me they heard very little background noise even when I was out on the noisy streets of New York. While the Shokz are arguably the best-sounding bone-conduction headphones, they aren't great-sounding for music because they're lacking in the bass department. But they're great for speech, so they work very well as a headset for making calls and listening to podcasts or audiobooks. These also have multipoint-Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with your phone and PC and easily switch to your phone if a call comes in while you're on your computer. And they come with either a USB-A or USB-C wireless dongle (you choose) that you plug into your computer for quick and reliable wireless connectivity.  As long as you don't mind the boom microphone, you can use the OpenComm 2 for sporting activities as well and are favorites for runners who want to keep their ears open to hear the outside world for safety reasons. They're also water-resistant. The only downside is they require a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C. Battery life is rated at 16 hours of talk time and 8 hours of listening.","3":"348","4":"0.9887","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,1.703532703800006,0,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,1.7973546927350068,1.0982156206740152,2.738327369300132,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,1.605490346858125,1.318240897874875,2.165161659012004,0.5863792051342392,2.9452774097006165,1.0263516022218886,1.7214012687821372,2.298329135661882,0.6037334148874748,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,1.3349026532532322,0.7660400754265337,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0,0.4746563726123323,2.1219954466557054,1.3021154416566612,2.4480865429903074,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,2.2985169467245052,2.939513633680062,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,2.1219954466557054,2.0794415416798357,1.2058504980021596,1.3583218771704109,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9056001223312122,3.9547226936246247,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,2.0097508300035996,1.0263516022218886,0,0.7814397877056235,1.5044392840432592,1.6253846624194561,3.125759150822494,1.490091154801534,1.362826163040005,3.125759150822494,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,1.7214012687821372,0,1.2653695754280638,0.6791609385852054,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"index":96},{"0":"Shokz OpenFit","1":"Shokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones.

The earbuds also sound quite good for open earbuds, though not quite as good as Cleer's Arc 2 Open Ear Sport earbuds ($170) that also have an ear-hook design.","3":"169","4":"0.9785","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0,0,1.5022688764205891,2.1000410350317886,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0,0,1.0982156206740152,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,1.3862943611198906,0,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0,0.963294208114875,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0,0,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0.7073318155519017,0,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0,0,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0,0.8250645506625137,0,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,0,0.3586354519493482,0,0.565996446278709,0,0,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,2.052703204443777,0,0,0,0,3.9071989385281176,1.490091154801534,0.6814130815200025,3.125759150822494,0.9484938723687899,0,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,0,0.7214144149333415,0,2.245511611715288,0.6791609385852054]},"index":97},{"0":"Shokz OpenMove","1":"Shokz' entry-level OpenMove bone-conduction headphone lists for $80, though we've occasionally seen it drop below $70.

That makes the OpenRun Pro the best bone-conduction headphones you can get right now, although they still can't match the sound quality of traditional headphones.Bone conduction wireless headphones don't go on your ears -- they actually deliver sound to your ear through your cheekbones. The big benefit of this technology as a safety feature for running is that, thanks to its open design, you can hear what's going on around you -- traffic noise in particular -- while listening to music or having a phone conversation (yes, they perform well for voice calls). Plus, some race coordinators don't allow runners to wear anything in their ears, which is where headphones like this come in handy.Like the Aeropex, the OpenRun Pro have a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame and are rated for up to 10 hours of music playback and you can get 1.5 hours of battery life from a 5-minute charge (they have a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C, which is unfortunate). I found them comfortable to wear but you may occasionally have to adjust them on your head to relieve potential pressure points. While they do offer a bit fuller sound with more bass -- it's an incremental improvement, not a huge leap forward -- like other bone-conduction headphones these are strongest in the midrange where voices live so they're very good for podcasts, talk radio, newscasts and audiobooks. A hard carrying case is included. Note that Shokz makes other, more affordable bone-conduction headphones, including the OpenRun, if you don't want to drop $180 on its current flagship model.","3":"291","4":"0.9806","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.5750307762738416,0,0.6814130815200025,0,1.9710702880982778,1.2501874346298594,0.7363193524251541,1.2501874346298594,1.7973546927350068,3.294646862022046,1.8255515795334214,1.0029595226955061,0.9484938723687899,0,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0,0,0,2.886882212016005,1.1727584102684785,2.2089580572754626,0.5131758011109443,2.2952016917095164,2.298329135661882,1.509333537218687,0,0,0,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0,0,1.3349026532532322,0.5106933836176891,0,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0.8126923312097281,1.1727584102684785,0.4746563726123323,0,2.170192402761102,0.6120216357475768,1.9139609724922169,0.7363193524251541,0,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,1.5571807922994405,0,0.8250645506625137,1.2240432714951537,0,2.0794415416798357,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,0,0.565996446278709,0,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,2.0059190453910123,0.8126923312097281,3.9071989385281176,2.980182309603068,0.6814130815200025,4.688638726233741,0,0,1.442828829866683,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0.8680769611044408,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,2.245511611715288,0]},"index":99},{"0":"Shure Aonic 215 II","1":"I liked Shure's original Aonic 215 true-wireless earbuds, but they were buggy and Shure pulled them off the market.

They have a hook that wraps around the top of your ear, and they stay in my ears very securely (even more securely than the Powerbeats Pro earbuds). Like that Beats model, they have a jumbo charging case. Even though it's technically bigger than the Powerbeats Pro's case, it doesn't feel bigger, perhaps because it's slightly thinner.What's interesting about them is that the Bluetooth module is detachable. (I liked the physical control button they have instead of touch controls.)  As the name implies, the Aonic 215 True Wireless Noise-Isolating Earphones incorporate Shure's SE215 buds, the $99 model in its line of earbuds that have detachable cables. The modules, which can be bought separately for $189, are designed to drive any Shure earbuds that have a detachable cable, including the $899 SE846.Headset performance has improved (they're now stereo rather than mono for calls) and they now have an IPX4 splash-proof water-resistance rating.

Well, the second-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours and added a quick-charge feature. It also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 one of the best new noise-canceling headphones. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They have excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure calls them \"studio headphones\" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference).Equipped with three microphones in each ear cup, I found the call quality to be good with decent noise reduction, and there's an adjustable sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice. I wouldn't say they're exceptionally good for calls in noisier environments.The headphones do have some extra features worth noting. They offer both LDAC and aptX support for Android and other devices that support those audio codecs.

I'd like to see them cost a little less, but hopefully, we'll see some discounts in the future.","3":"170","4":"0.9187","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,1.9139609724922169,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.64219613874325,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0.9056001223312122,1.024001424876935,0,1.562879575411247,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.4449675510844107,0.7660400754265337,0,0,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0,0,0.6120216357475768,0.9569804862461084,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,0,0,0,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0,1.4146636311038034,1.3862943611198906,0.40195016600071987,0,0.7172709038986964,0,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0,1.149164567830941,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0,1.562879575411247,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,2.2952016917095164,1.562879575411247,0,0.6791609385852054,0.8680769611044408,0,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,0]},"index":107},{"0":"Sony LinkBuds","1":"The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods.

That makes them a good choice for folks who want to hear what's going around them for safety reasons or just don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. They also have a few distinguishing extra features, including Speak to Chat and Wide Area Tap. Instead of tapping on a bud, you can tap on your face, just in front of your ear, to control playback.They're IPX4 splash-proof and thanks to their fins -- Sony calls them Arc Supporters -- they lock in your ears securely and work well for running and other sporting activities.","3":"162","4":"0.9107","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0,0,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,0,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,0,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,0,0.9798378778933541,0,0,0.64219613874325,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.6841337087864658,0,1.0438040521731147,0,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0.8899351021688214,0,0,0,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0,0,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7363193524251541,0,0.7661723155748351,1.9596757557867082,0.9343084753796642,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0,0.6931471805599453,0,0.6791609385852054,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0,2.3443193631168704,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,1.5022688764205891,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,1.6841337087864658,0]},"index":108},{"0":"Sony LinkBuds S","1":"Unlike the \"open\" LinkBuds, the LinkBuds S are traditional noise-isolating earbuds with tips that jam in your ears.

They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory, it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered a more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good-performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.","3":"313","4":"0.9979","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,2.3359534393456043,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0,1.469756816840031,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.2843922774865,3.9547226936246247,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,6.250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,2.245511611715288,0.9056001223312122,2.0876081043462293,0,1.2501874346298594,2.113066952106162,2.829327262207607,0,0.8899351021688214,2.0427735344707565,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,3.9922056987172176,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,0.5977257532489136,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.2501874346298594,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.509333537218687,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,2.3443193631168704,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,2.84548161710637,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0,1.5022688764205891,1.8035360373333535,0.5738004229273791,0,0]},"index":123},{"0":"Soundcore by Anker Life P2 Mini","1":"The Soundcore by Anker Life P2 Mini earbuds have been out for some time but remain a good budget option.

They're a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space One sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users.I found them comfortable to wear, but they do look a bit bulky compared to more premium models.","3":"208","4":"0.9945","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,1.0982156206740152,0,1.5044392840432592,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0.7073318155519017,0,1.7798702043376429,0,1.6573853451123386,1.9336860220739729,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0,1.4354707293691626,0,1.9961028493586088,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.2457446338395524,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,0,2.0097508300035996,0,0.4781806025991309,0,1.4149911156967727,0,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.2074668297749496,0,2.345516820536957,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,4.0634616560486405,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.5022688764205891,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"index":125},{"0":"Soundcore by Anker Space Q45","1":"If you can't afford Sony's WH-1000XM5 or Bose QC45, the Soundcore by Anker Space Q45 (yes, there's a bit of copying going on here) is a good alternative for $150, and we should see occasional discounts on it. While it may not fit some smaller heads, it's comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups and a dual-hinge folding design. Sound quality is very good and the headphones offer better noise canceling than the step-down Q35, as well as multipoint Bluetooth pairing (these are equipped with Bluetooth 5.3) and support for the LDAC audio codec for streaming high-resolution music tracks over Bluetooth, if you have a device that supports LDAC. Many Android phones do, although Samsung's Galaxy phones don't. Battery life is very good at up to 50 hours with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels and the headphones come with a hard carrying case for travel.

The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, though they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.While they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors, and they only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's in part due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side -- they feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water. The companion app for iOS is fairly basic, but you can upgrade the firmware and tweak the sound profile with a customizable EQ option.","3":"301","4":"0.9946","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,0,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,0.6250937173149297,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0,0.5491078103370076,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.963294208114875,0,2.886882212016005,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,1.7214012687821372,1.149164567830941,0.9056001223312122,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,2.113066952106162,2.1219954466557054,1.242254990896953,1.7798702043376429,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,2.9005290331109594,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,2.829327262207607,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,0.7661723155748351,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,0,2.0626613766562842,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,2.411700996004319,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0,1.6979893388361271,1.0045833390198333,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0,1.0029595226955061,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0,3.0045377528411783,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,1.6841337087864658,2.037482815755616]},"index":132},{"0":"SteelSeries Arctis 1","1":"If you want a much more affordable alternative to the 9X, check out the Arctis 1, a well-designed (but less swanky) wireless model that sells for about $90.

Equipped with a Qualcomm 3072 chip that supports Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec and LE Audio, they're IPX5 splashproof and also have an ambient mode that lets sound in, plus a low-latency gaming mode. Multipoint Bluetooth pairing is supported as well.Battery life is rated at six hours at moderate volume levels with noise canceling on (I got more like five hours) and up to nine hours with ANC off. The glossy black charging case, which offers wireless charging, does show fingerprints but is easy enough to wipe down, as are the buds themselves.

Its engineers tuned it to deliver even \"more detailed and precise  sound.\" I thought it sounded quite good, and the headset pairs to your phone and is also good for music listening and taking calls while you're gaming. There's an \"all-new\" Turtle Beach Hub app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak the audio and remap buttons. This headset will work with older Xbox One consoles as well as the next-gen Series consoles. Battery life is now up to 20 hours -- the headset charges via USB-C -- and thanks to Xbox Wireless technology, you can connect wirelessly to the Xbox without using a dongle like you have to do with the PS4. If you're looking at this versus the step-down Stealth 600 Gen 2, which retails for $80, that model is also good but the Stealth 700 Gen definitely has a more premium feel to it. It's really a good Xbox wireless headset for around $180.","3":"237","4":"0.9741","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,2.392451215615271,0,1.0500205175158943,2.686152141164524,0.6814130815200025,0,1.9710702880982778,0,0.7363193524251541,2.5003748692597187,2.995591154558345,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,0,0,0.48991893894667704,0,0,1.92658841622975,3.9547226936246247,0,0,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.6250937173149297,1.562879575411247,1.6841337087864658,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0,0,1.8112002446624245,2.829327262207607,1.242254990896953,0,0.5106933836176891,0,0,0,0,1.1727584102684785,0,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,1.3307352329057391,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0,2.0794415416798357,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0,1.131992892557418,4.018333356079333,1.875281151944789,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.2074668297749496,1.318240897874875,0,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,1.562879575411247,2.0059190453910123,0.8126923312097281,0,1.490091154801534,0,0.7814397877056235,0,1.6253846624194561,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,1.0544746461900532,2.7166437543408217,0,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"index":140},{"0":"V-Moda M-200","1":"V-Moda's M-200 is one of the few wired headphones on this list.

(Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage.

They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly.

That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads.The HX have custom 40mm drivers, Bluetooth 5.1 and support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive (that includes AptX HD) for high-resolution wireless streaming when you combine an aptX-enabled Android device with certain music-streaming services like Qobuz.Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound, overall well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. If you want to push the treble or bass, you can tweak the EQ in the Bang & Olufsen app for iOS and Android and give the headphones a warmer or brighter profile. Their noise canceling is also very good and voice-calling capabilities are also quite solid. Additionally, they offer multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them with a smartphone and PC simultaneously (Microsoft Swift Pair-enabled for Windows machines) so you can easily switch between the two. Battery life is rated at up to 35 hours with noise canceling on and 40 hours with it off.Earlier Bang & Olufsen models included a soft case (a pouch really), but the HX headphones come with a hard case. As I said, they're expensive, but the small improvements over earlier flagship Bang & Olufsen noise-canceling headphones help make the HX headphones a worthy alternative to the AirPods Max.","2":"Sleek design with premium build quality, Comfortable, Excellent sound, Impressive noise-canceling and voice-calling performance","3":"Pricey, Heavy","4":"8.0","5":"\"[\"\"The sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound","6":" overall well-balanced","7":" with deep","8":" well-defined bass","index":15},{"0":"Baseus Bowie MA10","1":"Priced at just $28 after you click an instant 20% discount coupon on Amazon, the Baseus Bowie MA10 delivers surprisingly good sound along with active noise canceling for its low price (you just don't see too many active noise canceling earbuds at this price).

The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price.

They're very accurate sounding. What's also nice is that the earbuds come with 10 ear tips of varying sizes, as well as a mix of silicone and foam tips (I was able to get a tight seal with the 3XL size ear tips). The neckband has a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and amplifier courtesy of AKM, and there's support for Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec for Android and other devices that support it (the LHDC codec is also supported).

It can also connect to a desk phone if you want to bring it to the office. Also worth noting: The boom microphone has a mute button on it, but when you flip it up it also automatically mutes the microphone. The original Voyager Focus doesn't mute when you lift the boom microphone.The Focus 2 comes in several different versions, including USB-A and USB-C models and a version that's Microsoft Teams certified. You can get the headset by itself or in a bundle that includes a charging dock. All versions include a nice protective carrying pouch.The Voyager Focus 2 UC is expensive but offers excellent performance and is quite comfortable for an on-ear headphone.

Additionally, the Free 60 Plus UC case also turns into a Bluetooth transceiver for inflight entertainment systems (you plug the case into the 3.5mm headphone port). I also liked how you can store the USB-A Bluetooth dongle in the charging case when you're not using it with your computer. Aside from the tricked out case, the bigl strengths of the Poly Voyager Free 60 are their comfortable fit, excellent voice-calling performance for video calls (they have three-mic array in each bud), solid noice canceling and very good sound quality. Equipped with 10mm drivers, they might not offer quite as good sound quality for music as other premium earbuds in this price range, but there's good depth and punch to the bass, decent clarity and they have a pleasant sound profile overall.

The soundstage also seems more spacious and airy -- yes, these are open-back headphones so they do leak sound.Note that the 660S2 require some extra power to drive (they're now 300-ohm headphones), so you'll want to pair them with a dedicated headphone amplifier.

Additionally, the microphone has moved from the left ear to the right and a convenient mute button has been added to the boom microphone -- an important addition. Since these leave your ears open -- the sound is conducted through your cheekbone -- they aren't for people who want to seal their ears out from outside noise. Rather, the idea is that you can hear everything around you without having anything covering your ears or jammed inside them. The headset is quite comfortable to wear. Some folks find that liberating and these do feature excellent noise reduction for calls, as callers told me they heard very little background noise even when I was out on the noisy streets of New York. While the Shokz are arguably the best-sounding bone-conduction headphones, they aren't great-sounding for music because they're lacking in the bass department. But they're great for speech, so they work very well as a headset for making calls and listening to podcasts or audiobooks.

They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.While they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors, and they only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's in part due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side -- they feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water.

That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams.

The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in.

They're very accurate sounding. What's also nice is that the earbuds come with 10 ear tips of varying sizes, as well as a mix of silicone and foam tips (I was able to get a tight seal with the 3XL size ear tips). The neckband has a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and amplifier courtesy of AKM, and there's support for Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec for Android and other devices that support it (the LHDC codec is also supported).

That design could be appealing to people who don't like having headphones in or on their ears and also offers a degree of safety for runners and bikers who want their ears open to the world.Bose has updated its line of audio sunglasses with three new models, including the Tempo sports model, which offers better sound and battery life than the more traditional-looking Tenor and Soprano. The Tempo has better specs all around, with USB-C charging and larger 22mm drivers. It also delivers up to 8 hours of battery life.Their sound is definitely improved from the original Frames. Bose says the Tempo plays \"deeper and louder -- loud enough for cycling at 25 mph -- while [you're] still able to hear traffic and your training partners.\" They're sweat-, weather-, scratch- and shatter-resistant, according to Bose, and fit under most protective helmets.

Secondly, the microphone configuration is different. Not only have the mics been shifted, but there's now an additional external microphone for voice pick-up, which means the QC45 has a total of six mics, four of which are beamforming and used for voice. By contrast, the QC35 II has four, two of which are used for voice. (The Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 also have six microphones total.)These headphones are excellent for making calls.

The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). The QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling, and strong voice-calling performance.  As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \"visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \"help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com. While the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than over the course of the year -- so look to buy them when they're on sale.

When they finally hit stores, the PX8's price jumped to $699 or a full $300 more than the company's step-down PX7 S2 headphones, which are also excellent (see below).The biggest difference between the PX8, which weigh in at 320 grams, and the PX7 S2 are the PX8's all-new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are \"inspired\" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 Series loudspeaker line. Bowers & Wilkins says these units help deliver superior resolution, detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the PX7 S2.Based on my tests, that's true. While I liked the PX7 S2, the PX8 headphones do sound more special, with a touch more openness and overall clarity. They're right near the top for sound in Bluetooth headphones and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions (there's no listening fatigue with these guys). For the best sound, you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USB-C to USB-C cable. As for the noise-canceling function, it's good but not quite on par with what you get from Sony's WH-1000XM5. And while the voice-calling capabilities are solid, these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls (the transparency mode is top-notch). While I can't say they're worth $300 more than the PX7 S2, they're a great set of cans if you can afford them. I do prefer the sound and overall performance of the more expensive Focal Bathys, though the Bathys don't have such strong noise canceling, but the PX8 headphones are a close second.","3":"Swanky style, Highly accurate sound, USB-C wired support","4":"Expensive, Noise-canceling can be better","index":37},{"0":"Cleer Audio Arc 2 Sport","1":"Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them.

That said, not everyone loves this style of open earbuds, which lets sound in so you can hear ambient sound around you for safety purposes.With a new six-axis motion sensor, you can actually control the buds with head gestures -- you answer calls by nodding and skip tracks forward by turning your head to the right and skip a track back by turning your head left. Thankfully, those motion controls can be turned off if you don't want to use them. These are among the first buds to support Qualcomm's aptX Lossless format, if you're one of the few to have an Android device that supports that audio codec (plenty of Android phones support aptX Adaptive). Since these aren't high-end noise-isolating earbuds, you probably won't be able to tell the difference in sound quality -- I couldn't -- but all that aside, these do sound very good for open-style earbuds. They lack a bit of oomph to their bass but they're punchy enough, offer good clarity and didn't distort at higher volumes. They also played sufficiently loud. They have an IPX5 water- and sweat-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water, and battery life is very good at up to eight hours on a single charge, plus there's a little more than three additional charges in the slim but still somewhat bulky charging case. It's big compared to an AirPods charging case, but svelte compared to other cases that house this style of earbuds.These offer respectable performance for voice calls, but callers did say they heard a certain amount of white noise when I spoke to them from the noisy streets of New York -- that whooshing sound is the by-product of the earbuds' noise-reduction efforts.","3":"","4":"","index":38},{"0":"Creative Sound Blaster Jam V2","1":"I was a fan of Creative's original Sound Blaster Jam headphones that came out in 2015 and had a decidedly retro look and feel, with good sound for the money.

Battery life is rated at up to 5.5 hours with noise canceling on. I was able to easily switch between using the buds with my computer (with the USB dongle) and my iPhone.

Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 one of the best new noise-canceling headphones. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They have excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure calls them \"studio headphones\" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference).Equipped with three microphones in each ear cup, I found the call quality to be good with decent noise reduction, and there's an adjustable sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice. I wouldn't say they're exceptionally good for calls in noisier environments.The headphones do have some extra features worth noting. They offer both LDAC and aptX support for Android and other devices that support those audio codecs. You can connect the headphones to a computer or smartphone with a USB-C cable for hi-res audio transmission or use the included analog cable if your device has a 3.5mm headphone port. That said, I found they played a little louder using a wireless Bluetooth connection (with LDAC) than when I connected them to a Samsung Galaxy Flip 5 via USB-C.","3":"Good build quality, Excellent sound quality Improved noise canceling, USB-C audio plus LDAC and aptX audio codec support","4":"Somewhat heavy, Carrying case is still a bit large","index":101},{"0":"Skullcandy Grom Wireless","1":"Skullcandy's Grom Wireless over-ear headphones are being targeted at kids, and they're a good choice for the 12-and-under set.

There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water. The companion app for iOS is fairly basic, but you can upgrade the firmware and tweak the sound profile with a customizable EQ option.","3":"Excellent sound and a comfortable, secure fit, Good noise canceling and call quality, Multipoint Bluetooth pairing&nbsp;, Good battery life","4":"They're big, No ear-detection sensors","index":132},{"0":"SteelSeries Arctis 1","1":"If you want a much more affordable alternative to the 9X, check out the Arctis 1, a well-designed (but less swanky) wireless model that sells for about $90. While you need to use a dongle (included), it works when connected to Xbox, Switch, PlayStation or even Android (the USB-C dongle includes a USB-A adapter cable). It's a good value, with a detachable Discord-certified microphone, and battery life is rated at up to 20 hours, which is pretty decent.","3":"","4":"","index":133},{"0":"SteelSeries Arctis 9X Wireless","1":"On the PlayStation and PC side, Arctis has its high-end Pro Wireless ($220), which some say is the best all-around headset for both those platforms. But for Xbox, the Arctis 9X Wireless is an excellent choice if you're looking for a more premium wireless headset. It connects directly to the Xbox wirelessly without a dongle and can also be used with your phone with a Bluetooth connection. It delivers 20 hours of battery life.","3":"","4":"","index":134},{"0":"Technics EAH-AZ60","1":"Panasonic's Technics EAH-AZ60 buds don't have quite as premium a feel as the earlier EAH-AZ70W, but they sound sweet with clean, well-balanced sound, well-defined bass and good detail. They feature active noise canceling (it's good), a transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth pairing (so you can connect to your computer and phone at the same time) and they have very solid voice-calling performance with good noise reduction. The buds are IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 7 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels. They're missing some features usually found at this price point: Notably, an ear-detection sensor that automatically pauses your music when you pull the earbuds out of your ears, and wireless charging (the former feature is more important). The step-down EAH-AZ40 also sounds good but the EAH-AZ60 not only has larger drivers (8mm compared to 6mm) but also supports Sony's LDAC audio codec and has two additional microphones for voice calling and noise canceling (the EAH-AZ40 doesn't have noise canceling).","3":"","4":"","index":135},{"0":"Technics EAH-AZ80","1":"You should expect a lot from earbuds that cost $300 -- and yes, that's still a lot to pay for headphones, even if plenty of people seem to be willing to pay upwards of $450 for the likes of Apple's AirPods Max headphones. Overall, Panasonic has done a nice job of creating an all-around top-performing set of buds that offer an improved fit with terrific sound, very good noise canceling and a robust feature set.Voice-calling capabilities are decent but don't quite live up to their billing (yet). Hopefully we'll see some firmware upgrades that improve the voice-calling experience in noisier environments. Despite that caveat, as long as they fit your ears well, the Technics EAH-AZ80 are right up there with the best wireless earbuds on the market right now.","2":"8.5","3":"Stellar sound and good noise canceling with improved fit, Good battery life, LDAC audio codec support for Android devices","4":"Pricey, Voice-calling performance is decent but could be slightly better","index":136},{"0":"Tranya Nova","1":"Tranya's Nova earbuds not only sound surprisingly good but also offer good noise-canceling performance for their modest price. Although you can tweak their sound with the equalizer in Tranya's companion app, at their balanced setting, they seem a bit more tuned to today's popular music, including hip hop and rap, delivering a full dose of bass (the buds have 12mm drivers) while not sounding boomy. Equipped with a Qualcomm 3072 chip that supports Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec and LE Audio, they're IPX5 splashproof and also have an ambient mode that lets sound in, plus a low-latency gaming mode. Multipoint Bluetooth pairing is supported as well.Battery life is rated at six hours at moderate volume levels with noise canceling on (I got more like five hours) and up to nine hours with ANC off. The glossy black charging case, which offers wireless charging, does show fingerprints but is easy enough to wipe down, as are the buds themselves. I thought the touch controls worked well, and callers said that while they heard a lot of background noise, they could hear my voice clearly during calls (the buds have three mics on each bud).While they're missing such premium features as ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the buds out of your ears, you couldn't ask for too much more from buds in this price range.","3":"Lightweight and attractively designed, Very good sound and good noise canceling for the price, Solid feature set, IPX5 splashproof","4":"Glossy finish shows fingerprints, No ear-detection sensors","index":137},{"0":"Tranya T20","1":"The Tranya T20 reminds me a little of a cheaper version of Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 without the noise canceling. They're pretty no-frills and missing more premium features such as an ear-detection sensor that automatically pauses your music when you take a bud out of your ears. They sound surprisingly decent for their modest price, if you get a tight seal, they sit pretty flush with your ears (they don't really stick out much) and they have decent battery life -- up to eight hours at moderate volume levels. They also work pretty well for making calls and are IPX7 waterproof.  The case feels a little cheap and the buds are lightweight. The Galaxy Buds 2 definitely feels more premium. The buds are well-tuned and have a relatively wide soundstage. Don't expect the world from them and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.","3":"Good price, Surprisingly good sound for the money, Relatively compact, Strong battery life and IPX7 waterproof","4":"No active noise canceling, Case feels a little cheap","index":138},{"0":"Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2","1":"If you can't quite afford Turtle Beach's Stealth 700 Gen 2, the Stealth 600 Gen 2 is a good alternative at under $100. While it doesn't have the more premium build quality of the Stealth 700, it's a very comfortable headset with good sound and performance. The audio quality has been improved slightly, and like the Stealth 700, it's equipped with a larger  high-sensitivity flip-to-mute mic that seamlessly integrates into the headset when retracted (muted). An audio preset button on the left ear cup allows you to quickly customize your audio, and thanks to Xbox Wireless technology, it's easy to connect to your Xbox. Battery life is rated at 15 hours, and the headset recharges via USB-C. The headset is pictured in white but is more readily available in black. The PlayStation version includes a dongle for wireless connectivity with the PS4 and PS5.","3":"","4":"","index":139},{"0":"Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2","1":"Turtle Beach has upgraded its popular Stealth 700 headset, improving both its performance and comfort. The build quality is solid and I liked the \"cooling gel-infused\" memory foam ear cushions, which really fit my head nicely and play well with glasses. The headband is also sturdy and well-padded.Turtle Beach says this Gen 2 model has improved 50mm Nanoclear drivers -- the sound is more detailed and \"precise\" -- there's a redesigned metal-reinforced headband and a larger, high-sensitivity flip-to-mute mic. Its engineers tuned it to deliver even \"more detailed and precise  sound.\" I thought it sounded quite good, and the headset pairs to your phone and is also good for music listening and taking calls while you're gaming. There's an \"all-new\" Turtle Beach Hub app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak the audio and remap buttons. This headset will work with older Xbox One consoles as well as the next-gen Series consoles. Battery life is now up to 20 hours -- the headset charges via USB-C -- and thanks to Xbox Wireless technology, you can connect wirelessly to the Xbox without using a dongle like you have to do with the PS4. If you're looking at this versus the step-down Stealth 600 Gen 2, which retails for $80, that model is also good but the Stealth 700 Gen definitely has a more premium feel to it. It's really a good Xbox wireless headset for around $180.","3":"","4":"","index":140},{"0":"V-Moda M-200","1":"V-Moda's M-200 is one of the few wired headphones on this list. Released in late 2019, these clean- and detailed-sounding over-ear headphones have excellent bass response, and the cushy earcups mean they're also comfortable to wear. Featuring 50mm drivers with neodymium magnets, CCAW voice coils and fine-tuning by Roland engineers -- yes, V-Moda is now owned by Roland -- the M‑200 is Hi‑Res Audio-certified by the Japan Audio Society. Other V-Moda headphones tend to push the bass a little, but this set has the more neutral profile that you'd expect from studio monitor headphones. They come with two cords, one of which has a built-in microphone for making calls. It would be nice if V-Moda offered Lightning or USB-C cables for phones without headphone jacks.Note that last year V-Moda released the  ($350), a wireless version of these headphones that includes active noise canceling. They also sound great, but their noise cancellation, call quality and overall feature set don't match those of the AirPods Max.","3":"Comfortable, Excellent sound, Includes a second cord with an

ComfoBuds 2","1":"1More has a slightly different take on the standard AirPods for those who have trouble keeping them in their ears. The ComfoBuds 2 have mini ear tips on them that help secure them in your ear. This second-gen version offers improved sound from the originals with better bass (it's still not great sound, but it's good for the money). As their name implies, they're lightweight, comfortable to wear and work well for making calls. It's worth noting that their charging case is remarkably narrow and compact. It looks like a tiny hot-dog bun. They're IPX5 splashproof and also available in black.","2":"No Data","3":"No Data","4":"8.6","index":1},{"0":"1More Fit SE S30","1":"1More makes a couple of open sports earbuds with ear hooks. The  buds are the flagship and feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). But I like the fit a little better on the step down S30, which is IPX5 splash-proof (can sustain a spray of water) and costs half the price, making it a better value.The case is bulky and feels a little cheap (the lid is flimsy) but the buds themselves seem sturdily built and the ear hooks are nice and flexible. They have 14.2mm drivers that output decent but not great sound (there's a bit of distortion at higher volumes), which is par for the course for these types of open buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. They're also good but not great for voice calling. A companion app for iOS and Android allows you to tweak the sound with an equalizer and you can update the buds' firmware. The buds are available in black or white and offer up to 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.","2":"Comfortable fit, Affordable price, Good sound for open earbuds, Good battery life","3":"Design is a bit plain, Case lid feels slightly flimsy","4":"8.1","index":2},{"0":"1More SonoFlow","1":"The design of 1More's SonoFlow headphones reminds me a little of some earlier Sony headphones and also the newer Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 4. They're a bit generic looking but sleek enough and more importantly, comfortable to wear. They also feature very respectable sound quality. While it doesn't quite measure up to the sound quality of what'll get with more premium models like the Momentum Wireless 4, it isn't that far off. The SonoFlow headphones deliver smooth sound with good clarity and relatively well-defined bass (they're just not quite as rich or dynamic sounding as those premium models I mentioned). They also have support for the LDAC audio codec.The noise canceling is a step down from what Sony and Bose models offer but it does a decent job of muffling ambient sound and there is a transparency mode. Voice-calling performance is similarly solid but unspectacular. Note that you can use this in wired mode with the included cable but the noise canceling only works in wireless mode, which is an issue for frequent flyers who like some noise canceling when plugging into an in-flight entertainment system.","2":"No Data","3":"No Data","4":"7.9","index":3},{"0":"AirPods (2nd Gen)","1":"The new AirPods (third gen) are a nice upgrade over the second-gen AirPods.

While they don't sound as good as the AirPods 3 and have a longer stem, they fit some people's ears better. Those with smaller ears may prefer these older AirPods due to their slightly smaller design.","2":"The second-generation AirPods add a couple of small but key improvements to the original, including always-on voice recognition and a wireless charging case option. They're a top-notch headset for making calls, indoors and out. Apple's new H1 chip also allows for faster connections with all of your Apple devices, rock solid wireless connectivity, and an hour more talk time.","3":"No design changes to help them fit more ears securely; their sound hasn't improved, and their open design allows for a lot of ambient noise to leak in.","4":"8.2","index":4},{"0":"AirPods 2nd Generation","1":"The third-gen AirPods are a nice upgrade over the second generation.

For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that of Apple's AirPods 3, which deliver fuller bass and overall fuller, smoother sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 3 cost around $150 and offer only about 15% to 20% better audio. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or \"semi-open\" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale.","2":"Well-designed inexpensive earbuds, Good sound for open earbuds, Strong feature set, including hands-free Alexa","3":"May not fit everyone's ears comfortably, Not a ton of bass, No ANC (they're open earbuds)","4":"8.6","index":8},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC","1":"New for 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than last year's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.","2":"More affordable and better than Liberty 4 buds, Comfortable fit with upgraded sound and noise canceling, Robust feature set and solid call quality","3":"Noise canceling could be a little better","4":"8.2","index":9},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Life Q20","1":"Anker's Soundcore Life Q20 is arguably the best value in noise-canceling headphones.

It's well balanced overall, with punchy bass, and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound. Noise canceling is good for the price, though certainly not up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones. Battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USB-C charging.The only area where the Q30 falls a little short is for voice calls. It picks up your voice fine in quieter environments but it just doesn't reduce background noise all that well. Compared to the Q20 (see below), the Q30 does offer improved sound (it's not a huge difference, but it definitely is a notch up) and a more premium design.

They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space Ones sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation.

That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads.The HX have custom 40mm drivers, Bluetooth 5.1 and support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive (that includes AptX HD) for high-resolution wireless streaming when you combine an aptX-enabled Android device with certain music-streaming services like Qobuz.Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound, overall well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. If you want to push the treble or bass, you can tweak the EQ in the Bang & Olufsen app for iOS and Android and give the headphones a warmer or brighter profile. Their noise canceling is also very good and voice-calling capabilities are also quite solid.

The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price.

As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \"visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \"help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com.

And now it's put out a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e with the \"e\" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been returned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip.These headphones are more comfortable than the original PX7s -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- and not only sound better but have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. The PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers excellent sound. Bowers & Wilkins also sell a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more.","2":"Improved comfort and sound quality, Better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance, Sturdy design, Support for aptX Adaptive audio codec for Android users","3":"Somewhat pricey, Slightly heavy","4":"8.7","index":36},{"0":"Bowers & Wilkins PX8","1":"When they were originally announced, Bowers & Wilkins' swanky PX8 noise-canceling headphones were supposed to cost $549 or essentially the same price as Apple's AirPod Max headphones. When they finally hit stores, the PX8's price jumped to $699 or a full $300 more than the company's step-down PX7 S2 headphones, which are also excellent (see below).The biggest difference between the PX8, which weigh in at 320 grams, and the PX7 S2 are the PX8's all-new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are \"inspired\" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 Series loudspeaker line. Bowers & Wilkins says these units help deliver superior resolution, detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the PX7 S2.Based on my tests, that's true. While I liked the PX7 S2, the PX8 headphones do sound more special, with a touch more openness and overall clarity. They're right near the top for sound in Bluetooth headphones and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions (there's no listening fatigue with these guys). For the best sound, you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USB-C to USB-C cable. As for the noise-canceling function, it's good but not quite on par with what you get from Sony's WH-1000XM5. And while the voice-calling capabilities are solid, these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls (the transparency mode is top-notch). While I can't say they're worth $300 more than the PX7 S2, they're a great set of cans if you can afford them. I do prefer the sound and overall performance of the more expensive Focal Bathys, though the Bathys don't have such strong noise canceling, but the PX8 headphones are a close second.","2":"Swanky style, Highly accurate sound, USB-C wired support","3":"Expensive, Noise-canceling can be better","4":"8.0","index":37},{"0":"Cleer Audio Arc 2 Sport","1":"Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. This new-for-2023 model steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new \"enhanced\" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which makes for a significantly improved product.Cleer says the Arc 2 Sport buds feature \"greater flexibility for improved comfort,\" and I did find them more comfortable to wear than the original Arcs. That said, not everyone loves this style of open earbuds, which lets sound in so you can hear ambient sound around you for safety purposes.With a new six-axis motion sensor, you can actually control the buds with head gestures -- you answer calls by nodding and skip tracks forward by turning your head to the right and skip a track back by turning your head left. Thankfully, those motion controls can be turned off if you don't want to use them. These are among the first buds to support Qualcomm's aptX Lossless format, if you're one of the few to have an Android device that supports that audio codec (plenty of Android phones support aptX Adaptive). Since these aren't high-end noise-isolating earbuds, you probably won't be able to tell the difference in sound quality -- I couldn't -- but all that aside, these do sound very good for open-style earbuds. They lack a bit of oomph to their bass but they're punchy enough, offer good clarity and didn't distort at higher volumes. They also played sufficiently loud. They have an IPX5 water- and sweat-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water, and battery life is very good at up to eight hours on a single charge, plus there's a little more than three additional charges in the slim but still somewhat bulky charging case. It's big compared to an AirPods charging case, but svelte compared to other cases that house this style of earbuds.These offer respectable performance for voice calls, but callers did say they heard a certain amount of white noise when I spoke to them from the noisy streets of New York -- that whooshing sound is the by-product of the earbuds' noise-reduction efforts.","2":"No Data","3":"No Data","4":"7.9","index":38},{"0":"Creative Sound Blaster Jam V2","1":"I was a fan of Creative's original Sound Blaster Jam headphones that came out in 2015 and had a decidedly retro look and feel, with good sound for the money.

Battery life is rated at up to 22 hours.I was able to pair this wireless headphone set with a Mac Mini and an iPhone 12 Pro and then switch audio between them. Often when pairing Bluetooth headphones with Mac and Windows PCs, one can encounter some issues, but once I got the headphones paired with both my PC and phone, they made a good pair of work-from-home headphones. Also, the price is right for parents looking for a decent set of kids' headphones for remote learning and everyday use.Comfortable for on-ear headphones, the Jam V2s are lightweight and have nicely balanced sound with good detail and bass that's ample but not overpowering. Call quality was good in my tests with callers saying they could hear me well even on the noisy streets of New York.

I'm not going to say the HS-2000BT is better than those models, but it's lightweight and comfortable to wear and offers similar features, including a retractable boom microphone with automatic muting (when you retract the boom mic). It also has a couple of bonus features: active noise canceling and wireless charging (Qi wireless charging pad not included). Callers said I sounded good though not quite as clear as when I was using the Logitech Zone Vibe 100.

It has a retractable boom microphone and good active noise canceling along with excellent noise reduction for calls (I made calls in the noisy streets of New York and callers said I sounded clear with little background noise intrusion). Flip the boom mic up and you automatically get muted during video conference calls; flip it down and you unmute yourself.With 28mm drivers, this headset also works well for listening to music and other audio, which is what you should expect for its high price tag. However, it only supports the SBC audio codec and not the superior AAC or aptX audio codecs (that's not the end of the world, but it is worth pointing out). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, you can connect it to a variety of devices wirelessly and the included Bluetooth USB-A dongle allows for easy pairing with PCs (you can connect it to two devices at the same time).

It is comfortable to wear for long periods with soft ear pads filled with high-quality memory foam. Like the Jabra, this Logitech has a retractable boom microphone with a mute button on it. It also has active noise cancellation and I thought it did a good job muffling external noise and reducing background noise when I was on calls. You can also toggle on a transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world. The headset is equipped with five microphones and uses Bluetooth 5.2 with a wireless range of 50 meters, which is much better than the typical 10-meter range of Bluetooth. Battery life is rated at up to 15 hours with noise canceling on and 18 hours with it off.People were impressed by how clear I sounded on calls, even when I tested the headset in the noisy streets of New York. Sound quality has also improved, and while this doesn't sound as good as Sony or Bose headphones, the sound quality for listening to music is quite respectable. It support the SBC, AAC and AptX audio codecs (Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex only supports SBC).The white version I tried was Microsoft Teams certified and came with a USB-A/USB-C Bluetooth dongle for computer use and a slim carry pouch.

There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, as well as the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that \"assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste.\" Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers \"best-in-class\" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks.

The second-generation OpenComm 2 UC costs more than the original, but it has an upgraded Bluetooth 5.1 chipset that improves performance a bit and now allows for the firmware upgrades that are required for Zoom certification. Additionally, the microphone has moved from the left ear to the right and a convenient mute button has been added to the boom microphone -- an important addition. Since these leave your ears open -- the sound is conducted through your cheekbone -- they aren't for people who want to seal their ears out from outside noise. Rather, the idea is that you can hear everything around you without having anything covering your ears or jammed inside them. The headset is quite comfortable to wear. Some folks find that liberating and these do feature excellent noise reduction for calls, as callers told me they heard very little background noise even when I was out on the noisy streets of New York. While the Shokz are arguably the best-sounding bone-conduction headphones, they aren't great-sounding for music because they're lacking in the bass department. But they're great for speech, so they work very well as a headset for making calls and listening to podcasts or audiobooks. These also have multipoint-Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with your phone and PC and easily switch to your phone if a call comes in while you're on your computer. And they come with either a USB-A or USB-C wireless dongle (you choose) that you plug into your computer for quick and reliable wireless connectivity.  As long as you don't mind the boom microphone, you can use the OpenComm 2 for sporting activities as well and are favorites for runners who want to keep their ears open to hear the outside world for safety reasons. They're also water-resistant. The only downside is they require a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C. Battery life is rated at 16 hours of talk time and 8 hours of listening.","2":"More refined sound and even better noise canceling, Slightly more comfortable, Best-in-class voice call quality, Pairs with two devices at the same time","3":"Higher price tag than previous model, Larger carrying case","4":"8.3","index":96},{"0":"Shokz OpenFit","1":"Shokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones.

However, Shokz's new OpenFit model, the company's first true-wireless earbuds, don't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fire sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology.I was impressed by how lightweight (8.3 grams) and comfortable they are -- they have one of the best ear-hook designs I've tried (Shokz calls it a Dolphin Arc ear hook). It's soft and offers just the right amount of flexibility to conform to the shape of your ear, with \"dual-layered liquid silicone that provides a pliable fit,\" according to Shokz.

That makes the OpenRun Pro the best bone-conduction headphones you can get right now, although they still can't match the sound quality of traditional headphones.Bone conduction wireless headphones don't go on your ears -- they actually deliver sound to your ear through your cheekbones. The big benefit of this technology as a safety feature for running is that, thanks to its open design, you can hear what's going on around you -- traffic noise in particular -- while listening to music or having a phone conversation (yes, they perform well for voice calls). Plus, some race coordinators don't allow runners to wear anything in their ears, which is where headphones like this come in handy.Like the Aeropex, the OpenRun Pro have a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame and are rated for up to 10 hours of music playback and you can get 1.5 hours of battery life from a 5-minute charge (they have a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C, which is unfortunate). I found them comfortable to wear but you may occasionally have to adjust them on your head to relieve potential pressure points. While they do offer a bit fuller sound with more bass -- it's an incremental improvement, not a huge leap forward -- like other bone-conduction headphones these are strongest in the midrange where voices live so they're very good for podcasts, talk radio, newscasts and audiobooks.

They have a hook that wraps around the top of your ear, and they stay in my ears very securely (even more securely than the Powerbeats Pro earbuds). Like that Beats model, they have a jumbo charging case. Even though it's technically bigger than the Powerbeats Pro's case, it doesn't feel bigger, perhaps because it's slightly thinner.What's interesting about them is that the Bluetooth module is detachable.

As the name implies, the Aonic 215 True Wireless Noise-Isolating Earphones incorporate Shure's SE215 buds, the $99 model in its line of earbuds that have detachable cables. The modules, which can be bought separately for $189, are designed to drive any Shure earbuds that have a detachable cable, including the $899 SE846.Headset performance has improved (they're now stereo rather than mono for calls) and they now have an IPX4 splash-proof water-resistance rating.

It also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 one of the best new noise-canceling headphones. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They have excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure calls them \"studio headphones\" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference).Equipped with three microphones in each ear cup, I found the call quality to be good with decent noise reduction, and there's an adjustable sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice. I wouldn't say they're exceptionally good for calls in noisier environments.The headphones do have some extra features worth noting. They offer both LDAC and aptX support for Android and other devices that support those audio codecs. You can connect the headphones to a computer or smartphone with a USB-C cable for hi-res audio transmission or use the included analog cable if your device has a 3.5mm headphone port.

(Many Android smartphones do, and in theory, it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered a more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly.

They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space One sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK.

The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, though they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.While they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors, and they only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's in part due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side -- they feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water.

But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that of Apple's AirPods 3, which deliver fuller bass and overall fuller, smoother sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 3 cost around $150 and offer only about 15% to 20% better audio. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or \"\"semi-open\"\" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale.\"","2":"Well-designed inexpensive earbuds, Good sound for open earbuds, Strong feature set, including hands-free Alexa","3":"May not fit everyone's ears comfortably, Not a ton of bass, No ANC (they're open earbuds)","4":"8.6","5":"['sound good for inexpensive open earbuds', 'decent clarity', 'ample bass', 'robust feature set', 'multipoint Bluetooth pairing', 'hands-free Alexa', 'ear-detection sensors', 'good value at $50 list price']","6":"\"[\"\"sound falls short of Apple's AirPods 3\"\"","7":" 'not as good at handling more complicated music tracks']\"","8":"Wireless Earbuds","index":8},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC","1":"New for 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than last year's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.","2":"More affordable and better than Liberty 4 buds, Comfortable fit with upgraded sound and noise canceling, Robust feature set and solid call quality","3":"Noise canceling could be a little better","4":"8.2","5":"['improved noise canceling', 'better sound quality', 'support for LDAC audio codec', 'lightweight and comfortable design', 'good battery life', 'transparent mode', 'effective noise canceling', 'good call quality', 'strong feature set', 'wireless charging', 'good performing earbuds']","6":"['noise canceling falls short of premium ANC earbuds', 'expensive']","7":"Earbuds","8":"Anker","index":9},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Life Q20","1":"Anker's Soundcore Life Q20 is arguably the best value in noise-canceling headphones.

It's well balanced overall, with punchy bass, and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound. Noise canceling is good for the price, though certainly not up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones. Battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USB-C charging.The only area where the Q30 falls a little short is for voice calls. It picks up your voice fine in quieter environments but it just doesn't reduce background noise all that well. Compared to the Q20 (see below), the Q30 does offer improved sound (it's not a huge difference, but it definitely is a notch up) and a more premium design.

They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space Ones sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation.

That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads.The HX have custom 40mm drivers, Bluetooth 5.1 and support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive (that includes AptX HD) for high-resolution wireless streaming when you combine an aptX-enabled Android device with certain music-streaming services like Qobuz.Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound, overall well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. If you want to push the treble or bass, you can tweak the EQ in the Bang & Olufsen app for iOS and Android and give the headphones a warmer or brighter profile. Their noise canceling is also very good and voice-calling capabilities are also quite solid. Additionally, they offer multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them with a smartphone and PC simultaneously (Microsoft Swift Pair-enabled for Windows machines) so you can easily switch between the two. Battery life is rated at up to 35 hours with noise canceling on and 40 hours with it off.Earlier Bang & Olufsen models included a soft case (a pouch really), but the HX headphones come with a hard case.

Additionally, the Free 60 Plus UC case also turns into a Bluetooth transceiver for inflight entertainment systems (you plug the case into the 3.5mm headphone port). I also liked how you can store the USB-A Bluetooth dongle in the charging case when you're not using it with your computer. Aside from the tricked out case, the bigl strengths of the Poly Voyager Free 60 are their comfortable fit, excellent voice-calling performance for video calls (they have three-mic array in each bud), solid noice canceling and very good sound quality.

Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity.

(Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly.

The QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling, and strong voice-calling performance.  As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \"visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \"help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades.

The PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers excellent sound. Bowers & Wilkins also sell a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more.","2":"Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2e","3":"Improved comfort and sound quality, Better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance, Sturdy design, Support for aptX Adaptive audio codec for Android users","index":38},{"0":"Voice-calling performance could be slightly better, Noise canceling isn't that strong, Semi-open design allows some sound to leak in","1":"Yes, the Elite 10s do have some potential drawbacks (their noise canceling is lighter compared with competitors), and they're pretty pricey at $197 and will probably have to come down a bit to better compete with the AirPods Pro 2 -- at least for Apple users. Still, they're really good earbuds that are not only comfortable to wear for long periods but also sound excellent. In fact, if their voice-calling performance is leveled up a bit with a firmware update, the Elite 10 buds may just be in Editors' Choice territory.","2":"Jabra Elite 10","3":"Very comfortable fit, Excellent sound, Dolby Spatial Sound with head tracking, Fully waterproof","index":39},{"0":"Expensive, Noise-canceling can be better","1":"When they were originally announced, Bowers & Wilkins' swanky PX8 noise-canceling headphones were supposed to cost $549 or essentially the same price as Apple's AirPod Max headphones. When they finally hit stores, the PX8's price jumped to $699 or a full $300 more than the company's step-down PX7 S2 headphones, which are also excellent (see below).The biggest difference between the PX8, which weigh in at 320 grams, and the PX7 S2 are the PX8's all-new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are \"inspired\" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 Series loudspeaker line. Bowers & Wilkins says these units help deliver superior resolution, detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the PX7 S2.Based on my tests, that's true. While I liked the PX7 S2, the PX8 headphones do sound more special, with a touch more openness and overall clarity. They're right near the top for sound in Bluetooth headphones and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions (there's no listening fatigue with these guys). For the best sound, you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USB-C to USB-C cable. As for the noise-canceling function, it's good but not quite on par with what you get from Sony's WH-1000XM5. And while the voice-calling capabilities are solid, these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls (the transparency mode is top-notch). While I can't say they're worth $300 more than the PX7 S2, they're a great set of cans if you can afford them. I do prefer the sound and overall performance of the more expensive Focal Bathys, though the Bathys don't have such strong noise canceling, but the PX8 headphones are a close second.","2":"Bowers & Wilkins PX8","3":"Swanky style, Highly accurate sound, USB-C wired support","index":40},{"0":"No support for aptX or LDAC audio codecs for Android users, A few features not available for Apple users","1":"The Pixel Buds Pro are Google's first earbuds to feature active noise canceling.

The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in.

They're very accurate sounding. What's also nice is that the earbuds come with 10 ear tips of varying sizes, as well as a mix of silicone and foam tips (I was able to get a tight seal with the 3XL size ear tips). The neckband has a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and amplifier courtesy of AKM, and there's support for Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec for Android and other devices that support it (the LHDC codec is also supported).

Well, the second-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours and added a quick-charge feature. It also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 one of the best new noise-canceling headphones. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They have excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure calls them \"studio headphones\" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference).Equipped with three microphones in each ear cup, I found the call quality to be good with decent noise reduction, and there's an adjustable sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice. I wouldn't say they're exceptionally good for calls in noisier environments.The headphones do have some extra features worth noting. They offer both LDAC and aptX support for Android and other devices that support those audio codecs. You can connect the headphones to a computer or smartphone with a USB-C cable for hi-res audio transmission or use the included analog cable if your device has a 3.5mm headphone port.

Is it possible that new acoustic architecture makes the buds sound subtly different with current devices like the iPhone? Maybe, maybe not.

The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, though they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.While they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors, and they only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's in part due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side -- they feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water.

That helps enhance their performance on both the sound quality and noise-canceling fronts. While not quite elite for voice-calling, they did perform well as a headset for making calls.

The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, though they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.While they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors, and they only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's in part due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side -- they feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water. The companion app for iOS is fairly basic, but you can upgrade the firmware and tweak the sound profile with a customizable EQ option.","2":"Status Between 3ANC","3":"Great voice-calling, Secure ear fit","index":70},{"0":"Included ear tips might not get you a tight seal, Chrome accent on stem is a bit gaudy","1":"Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited.

Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, they also have support for a good range of audio codecs, including AAC (iPhones), LHDC 4.0, SBC, and LC3 (the successor to SBC). OnePlus says an upgrade to LHDC 5.0 will be available via a firmware upgrade (LHDC stands for low-latency high-definition and it's supposed to be close to on par with Sony's LDAC audio codec).I found the noise-canceling to be good but not up to the level of what you get with Apple, Sony and Bose earbuds. Voice-calling performance was also above average with decent though not fantastic noise reduction on the streets of New York. (Callers said they could hear me well despite some background noise so the microphone quality seems good.) Owners of the new OnePlus 11 smartphone can take advantage of the buds' spatial audio feature. (Other smartphones may support spatial audio with the Buds Pro 2 in the future but for now, it's exclusive to the OnePlus 11.)

They have slightly larger wool-composite drivers (11mm versus 10mm), slightly improved noise canceling and better battery life (up to seven hours with noise canceling on, according to Earfun).In short, the Earfun Air 3 delivers strong performance for its modest price, with robust bass, good clarity and a relatively wide soundstage. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and \"multidevice\" connectivity.

While this is an on-ear headset, it has a nicely padded headband and earpieces and is impressively comfortable (it also helps that it's relatively lightweight, weighing 136 grams or 4.8 ounces).I was impressed with the sound and performance of the Evolve2 65 Flex. It has a retractable boom microphone and good active noise canceling along with excellent noise reduction for calls (I made calls in the noisy streets of New York and callers said I sounded clear with little background noise intrusion). Flip the boom mic up and you automatically get muted during video conference calls; flip it down and you unmute yourself.With 28mm drivers, this headset also works well for listening to music and other audio, which is what you should expect for its high price tag. However, it only supports the SBC audio codec and not the superior AAC or aptX audio codecs (that's not the end of the world, but it is worth pointing out). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, you can connect it to a variety of devices wirelessly and the included Bluetooth USB-A dongle allows for easy pairing with PCs (you can connect it to two devices at the same time).

It is comfortable to wear for long periods with soft ear pads filled with high-quality memory foam. Like the Jabra, this Logitech has a retractable boom microphone with a mute button on it. It also has active noise cancellation and I thought it did a good job muffling external noise and reducing background noise when I was on calls. You can also toggle on a transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world. The headset is equipped with five microphones and uses Bluetooth 5.2 with a wireless range of 50 meters, which is much better than the typical 10-meter range of Bluetooth. Battery life is rated at up to 15 hours with noise canceling on and 18 hours with it off.People were impressed by how clear I sounded on calls, even when I tested the headset in the noisy streets of New York. Sound quality has also improved, and while this doesn't sound as good as Sony or Bose headphones, the sound quality for listening to music is quite respectable. It support the SBC, AAC and AptX audio codecs (Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex only supports SBC).The white version I tried was Microsoft Teams certified and came with a USB-A/USB-C Bluetooth dongle for computer use and a slim carry pouch.

The second-generation OpenComm 2 UC costs more than the original, but it has an upgraded Bluetooth 5.1 chipset that improves performance a bit and now allows for the firmware upgrades that are required for Zoom certification. Additionally, the microphone has moved from the left ear to the right and a convenient mute button has been added to the boom microphone -- an important addition. Since these leave your ears open -- the sound is conducted through your cheekbone -- they aren't for people who want to seal their ears out from outside noise. Rather, the idea is that you can hear everything around you without having anything covering your ears or jammed inside them. The headset is quite comfortable to wear. Some folks find that liberating and these do feature excellent noise reduction for calls, as callers told me they heard very little background noise even when I was out on the noisy streets of New York. While the Shokz are arguably the best-sounding bone-conduction headphones, they aren't great-sounding for music because they're lacking in the bass department. But they're great for speech, so they work very well as a headset for making calls and listening to podcasts or audiobooks. These also have multipoint-Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with your phone and PC and easily switch to your phone if a call comes in while you're on your computer. And they come with either a USB-A or USB-C wireless dongle (you choose) that you plug into your computer for quick and reliable wireless connectivity.  As long as you don't mind the boom microphone, you can use the OpenComm 2 for sporting activities as well and are favorites for runners who want to keep their ears open to hear the outside world for safety reasons. They're also water-resistant. The only downside is they require a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C.

Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users.I found them comfortable to wear, but they do look a bit bulky compared to more premium models.","2":"Soundcore by Anker Space One","3":"Strong feature set, Very good sound quality for their price, Decent noise canceling and voice calling, LDAC audio codec support&nbsp;","index":303},{"0":"Voice-calling performance could be better, Noise-canceling performance is fine but not great","1":"As far as sound, comfort level and build quality go, you'd be hard-pressed to do better than Anker's Soundcore Life Q30 for the money. It doesn't have quite the clarity or bass definition as some of the top premium models, but it's less than a third of the price and gets you about 75% of the way there in terms of sound. It's well balanced overall, with punchy bass, and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound. Noise canceling is good for the price, though certainly not up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones. Battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USB-C charging.The only area where the Q30 falls a little short is for voice calls. It picks up your voice fine in quieter environments but it just doesn't reduce background noise all that well. Compared to the Q20 (see below), the Q30 does offer improved sound (it's not a huge difference, but it definitely is a notch up) and a more premium design. There's also the newer  ($100), which adds support for Sony's LDAC audio codec for high-resolution audio streaming with music services that support it.","2":"Anker Soundcore Life Q30","3":"Comfortable, Decent build quality for their price, Good sound for their price, Good battery life","index":304},{"0":"Voice-calling performance could be better, Noise-canceling performance is fine but not great","1":"Anker's Soundcore Life Q20 Plus is among the best values in noise-canceling headphones. Not only do these budget noise-canceling over-ear headphones sound quite decent for around $40, they're also comfortable to wear thanks to their puffy ear pads. Compared to the earlier Life Q20, this Plus model adds app support and USB-C charging (instead of Micro-USB) for $10 more.No, the Life Q20 Plus doesn't sound nearly as good as premium Bluetooth headphones such as the Sony WH-1000XM5, but the audio quality sounds pretty good, which is all you can ask for noise-canceling headphones at this price. It's fairly well balanced with a reasonable amount of clarity and plump bass that's not bloated or muddy (there's a bass boost or BassUp mode if you want an extra helping of bass with your music). Also, the noise cancelation is acceptably effective at noise reduction and blocking out ambient sound and it's decent enough as a headset for making calls. Battery life is good at 40 hours. A simple carrying pouch is included.","2":"Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Plus","3":"Lightweight and comfortable, Good sound for their price, Good battery life, Connect with Soundcore app&nbsp;","index":305},{"0":"No companion app (so no firmware upgrades)","1":"JLab makes the cheaper Studio Pro headphones, which don't have active noise canceling, and this model, which does.

There are two levels of noise canceling to choose from along with a transparency mode and the headphones have multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them simultaneously with a smartphone and computer.Like I said about the Studio Pro, don't expect these to deliver the clarity and definition of higher-end headphones, but the bass has some punch to it and there's an acceptable amount of detail. You can choose between three sound modes -- JLab signature sound, balance and bass boost.

There's no active noise-canceling and the headphones are pretty no frills, but they do feature decent sound quality with ample bass for their low price, and you can pair them to two devices simultaneously (multipoint Bluetooth). I'm slightly more partial to the Sony CH-520, which are slightly more comfortable and sound slightly better (they have a tad more clarity). That said, the H30i have a folding design, and while they don't come with a carrying pouch, they do include a headphone cord for wired listening (the Sonys are wireless only).Battery life is impressive -- the H30i are rated for up to 70 hours of listening at moderate volume levels. And while you shouldn't expect great voice-calling performance, it is acceptable in quieter environments. I also appreciated that you can tweak the sound profile in the companion Soundcore app for iOS and Android.","2":"Soundcore by Anker H30i","3":"Inexpensive, Attractive design, Decent sound, Excellent battery life","index":307},{"0":"Only available in black","1":"Skullcandy's Grom Wireless over-ear headphones are being targeted at kids, and they're a good choice for the 12-and-under set.

They're quite good, but if you can't afford them (they list for $150), the company's new budget on-ear CH-520 headphones are an intriguing option for only around $50.They lack noise canceling and are pretty no-frills, but they feature good sound for their price, are lightweight, and pretty comfortable for on-ear headphones, and also have excellent battery life (they're rated for up to 50 hours at moderate volume levels). Additionally, they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with two devices simultaneously, such as a smartphone and computer, and switch audio. Voice-calling performance is decent, though not up to the level of what you get with the CH-720N. Note that there's no wired option -- this is a wireless Bluetooth-only headphone. The CH-520 offers overall balanced sound with decent clarity. The bass has some punch to it but doesn't pack a wallop, and you're not going to get quite as wide a soundstage as you get from Sony's more expensive over-ear headphones. But these definitely sound better than Sony's previous entry-level on-ear headphones and sound better than I thought they would.

Note that only the black model has ANC; the other colors don't (they cost $30 instead of $33).

Now they're available in a 2.0 version that has some key upgrades, including Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C charging, improved call quality and multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to pair it to two devices simultaneously. Battery life is rated at up to 22 hours.I was able to pair this wireless headphone set with a Mac Mini and an iPhone 12 Pro and then switch audio between them. Often when pairing Bluetooth headphones with Mac and Windows PCs, one can encounter some issues, but once I got the headphones paired with both my PC and phone, they made a good pair of work-from-home headphones. Also, the price is right for parents looking for a decent set of kids' headphones for remote learning and everyday use.Comfortable for on-ear headphones, the Jam V2s are lightweight and have nicely balanced sound with good detail and bass that's ample but not overpowering. Call quality was good in my tests with callers saying they could hear me well even on the noisy streets of New York. No carry pouch is included, but you do get an extra set of foam ear pads, which is good, because they will wear out over time.The headphones have physical buttons for controlling volume and playback, and there's aptX support for devices that support the wireless streaming codec.","2":"Creative Sound Blaster Jam V2","3":"Affordable, Lightweight and compact, Good sound, Multipoint Bluetooth pairing","index":312}],"schema":[{"key":"0","name":"Cons","type":"string"},{"key":"1","name":"Product Description","type":"string"},{"key":"2","name":"Product Name","type":"string"},{"key":"3","name":"Pros","type":"string"},{"key":"4","name":"Rating","type":"string"}],"truncated":false},"isSummary":false,"language":"scala"},"persist_state":{"view":{"type":"details","tableOptions":{},"chartOptions":{"chartType":"bar","categoryFieldKeys":["0"],"seriesFieldKeys":["0"],"aggregationType":"count","isStacked":false,"binsNumber":10,"wordFrequency":"-1"}}}},"5402d7da-8667-4fa5-89b4-a1272fef46c1":{"type":"Synapse.DataFrame","sync_state":{"table":{"rows":[{"0":"1More ComfoBuds 2","1":"1More has a slightly different take on the standard AirPods for those who have trouble keeping them in their ears.

Note that you can use this in wired mode with the included cable but the noise canceling only works in wireless mode, which is an issue for frequent flyers who like some noise canceling when plugging into an in-flight entertainment system.","3":"185","4":"0.9887","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,1.4015720636073625,0,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.5991182309116689,1.647323431011023,0,0,1.8969877447375798,2.0794415416798357,0.4671906878691208,0,0,1.2669476034873244,0.321098069371625,0,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,0.9056001223312122,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,0.8899351021688214,0,0,0,0.8489946694180636,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.469756816840031,1.8686169507593284,0,0.8250645506625137,0,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,0,0,0.4781806025991309,0,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0,3.447493703492823,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0,2.0059190453910123,0,0,0,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6326847877140319,0,0,1.5022688764205891,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,10,11,14,15,18,19,20,23,24,28,30,31,32,34,35,37,39,40,44,48,50,51,52,53,54,55,57,58,59,60,62,64,65,68,70,71,73,75,77,80,81,83,89,91,92,94,97,98,99,101],"values":[185,0.9887,1.1982364618233379,1.4015720636073625,0.34070654076000123,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,1.647323431011023,1.8969877447375798,2.0794415416798357,0.4671906878691208,1.2669476034873244,0.321098069371625,1.4726387048503082,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,0.9056001223312122,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0.3018667074437374,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.8899351021688214,0.8489946694180636,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.469756816840031,1.8686169507593284,0.8250645506625137,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,0.4781806025991309,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,3.447493703492823,0.9056001223312122,0.5863792051342392,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,2.0059190453910123,0.9484938723687899,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0.6326847877140319,1.5022688764205891,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"7.931445194337092","index":3},{"0":"AirPods (2nd Gen)","1":"The new AirPods (third gen) are a nice upgrade over the second-gen AirPods.

Callers said they could hear me clearly even with a lot background noise in the streets of New York City. The only issue is that since they are open earbuds, they let sound in, so you may not be able to hear callers as well as they can hear you in noisier environments.","3":"181","4":"0.9788","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,0,0,0.5014797613477531,1.8969877447375798,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0,0.963294208114875,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0,0,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.3349026532532322,0.5106933836176891,0,1.9336860220739729,0.2829982231393545,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0.4340384805522204,0.6120216357475768,0,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,1.2240432714951537,0,1.3862943611198906,0,3.3958046929260273,0.23909030129956546,1.9336860220739729,0,1.0045833390198333,0,1.149164567830941,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,0,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,1.0221196222800037,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,2.037482815755616,0,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,5.4332875086816435]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,13,14,17,18,19,20,21,22,24,26,29,32,33,35,37,38,39,40,41,44,45,47,48,49,50,53,54,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,65,67,68,69,71,73,75,78,79,80,85,87,89,92,93,94,95,97,98,99,101],"values":[181,0.9788,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,0.5014797613477531,1.8969877447375798,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0.963294208114875,0.7217205530040013,0.5131758011109443,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,1.3349026532532322,0.5106933836176891,1.9336860220739729,0.2829982231393545,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.4340384805522204,0.6120216357475768,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,1.2240432714951537,1.3862943611198906,3.3958046929260273,0.23909030129956546,1.9336860220739729,1.0045833390198333,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0.7814397877056235,1.0221196222800037,1.8969877447375798,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,2.037482815755616,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,5.4332875086816435]},"7":"8.815507963597835","index":7},{"0":"Amazon Echo Buds 2023","1":"Amazon's 2023 Echo Buds impressed me in a few ways that I wasn't expecting. For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that of Apple's AirPods 3, which deliver fuller bass and overall fuller, smoother sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 3 cost around $150 and offer only about 15% to 20% better audio. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or \"semi-open\" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale.","3":"153","4":"0.9845","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0,1.5022688764205891,0,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,0,0.9343813757382416,0,0,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,0,0.3018667074437374,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0.561377902928822,0,0,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,1.5320801508530675,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0,0,0.6653676164528696,0,0,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,0,0,2.829327262207607,0,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,1.0263516022218886,0,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0,0,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,8,9,13,17,18,20,24,27,29,30,32,34,36,39,40,41,43,44,45,46,47,49,50,52,53,54,57,60,61,64,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,77,80,82,83,84,85,87,88,91,92,94,98,99,101],"values":[153,0.9845,0.5991182309116689,1.5022688764205891,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0.6250937173149297,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,0.9343813757382416,0.321098069371625,0.5863792051342392,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,0.3018667074437374,1.2501874346298594,0.561377902928822,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,1.5320801508530675,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.6653676164528696,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,2.829327262207607,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0.5863792051342392,1.0263516022218886,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0.4217898584760213,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.591327881325212","index":8},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC","1":"New for 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than last year's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.","3":"313","4":"0.9981","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,2.3359534393456043,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0,1.469756816840031,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.2843922774865,3.9547226936246247,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,0,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,6.250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,2.245511611715288,0.9056001223312122,2.0876081043462293,0,1.2501874346298594,2.113066952106162,2.829327262207607,0,0.8899351021688214,2.0427735344707565,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,3.9922056987172176,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,0.5977257532489136,0,0.8489946694180636,0,1.2501874346298594,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.509333537218687,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,2.3443193631168704,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,2.84548161710637,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0,1.5022688764205891,1.8035360373333535,0.5738004229273791,0,0]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[313,0.9981,0,2.3359534393456043,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0,1.469756816840031,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.2843922774865,3.9547226936246247,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,0,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,6.250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,2.245511611715288,0.9056001223312122,2.0876081043462293,0,1.2501874346298594,2.113066952106162,2.829327262207607,0,0.8899351021688214,2.0427735344707565,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,3.9922056987172176,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,0.5977257532489136,0,0.8489946694180636,0,1.2501874346298594,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.509333537218687,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,2.3443193631168704,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,2.84548161710637,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0,1.5022688764205891,1.8035360373333535,0.5738004229273791,0,0]},"7":"8.205164566453872","index":9},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Life Q20","1":"Anker's Soundcore Life Q20 is arguably the best value in noise-canceling headphones.

A simple carrying pouch is included.","3":"169","4":"0.9901","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0,0.7363193524251541,1.875281151944789,1.1982364618233379,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,0,0.9484938723687899,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,0,0,1.2843922774865,1.318240897874875,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0,0,0,0,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,1.0438040521731147,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0,0,2.486078017668508,1.9336860220739729,0.565996446278709,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0,1.3021154416566612,0,0,0,0,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,0.9343084753796642,1.9552858931912729,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,0,1.131992892557418,1.0045833390198333,0,1.149164567830941,0,0,0,1.1727584102684785,0,1.6078006640028795,0.5131758011109443,0,0,1.0029595226955061,0.8126923312097281,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,0,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,1.122755805857644,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,20,21,24,25,28,29,30,36,37,38,40,42,43,46,47,48,50,51,53,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,70,71,73,77,79,80,83,84,87,88,93,94,96,98,99,100],"values":[169,0.9901,1.1982364618233379,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0.7363193524251541,1.875281151944789,1.1982364618233379,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,0.9484938723687899,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,1.2843922774865,1.318240897874875,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,1.0438040521731147,0.6250937173149297,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,2.486078017668508,1.9336860220739729,0.565996446278709,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,1.3021154416566612,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,0.9343084753796642,1.9552858931912729,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,1.131992892557418,1.0045833390198333,1.149164567830941,1.1727584102684785,1.6078006640028795,0.5131758011109443,1.0029595226955061,0.8126923312097281,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.8680769611044408,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,1.122755805857644]},"7":"7.739196846655899","index":11},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Life Q30","1":"As far as sound, comfort level and build quality go, you'd be hard-pressed to do better than Anker's Soundcore Life Q30 for the money. It doesn't have quite the clarity or bass definition as some of the top premium models, but it's less than a third of the price and gets you about 75% of the way there in terms of sound. It's well balanced overall, with punchy bass, and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound. Noise canceling is good for the price, though certainly not up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones. Battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USB-C charging.The only area where the Q30 falls a little short is for voice calls. It picks up your voice fine in quieter environments but it just doesn't reduce background noise all that well. Compared to the Q20 (see below), the Q30 does offer improved sound (it's not a huge difference, but it definitely is a notch up) and a more premium design. There's also the newer  ($100), which adds support for Sony's LDAC audio codec for high-resolution audio streaming with music services that support it.","3":"198","4":"0.9885","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,1.4015720636073625,0.9569804862461084,0,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,0.7969439742415889,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,1.1727584102684785,0,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6037334148874748,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0,0.561377902928822,1.509333537218687,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,0.5106933836176891,2.486078017668508,1.9336860220739729,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0,0.4746563726123323,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0,1.5323446311496702,0.9798378778933541,1.5571807922994405,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0,0.8039003320014397,0,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0.8126923312097281,0,0,1.362826163040005,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,2.037482815755616]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,15,16,17,19,20,22,24,27,30,32,33,34,36,37,40,41,45,46,47,48,49,51,52,53,56,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,66,67,68,70,72,73,75,79,83,84,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,96,97,98,100,101],"values":[198,0.9885,1.4015720636073625,0.9569804862461084,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0.7969439742415889,0.321098069371625,1.1727584102684785,1.1476008458547582,0.6037334148874748,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0.561377902928822,1.509333537218687,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,0.5106933836176891,2.486078017668508,1.9336860220739729,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.4746563726123323,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0.7363193524251541,1.5323446311496702,0.9798378778933541,1.5571807922994405,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0.2829982231393545,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,0.9056001223312122,0.8039003320014397,0.5014797613477531,0.8126923312097281,1.362826163040005,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.21089492923801065,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,1.122755805857644,2.037482815755616]},"7":"8.25119403996745","index":12},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Space One","1":"Available in three color options, the Soundcore Space One are Anker's latest noise-canceling headphones and a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space Ones sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users.I found them comfortable to wear, but they do look a bit bulky compared to more premium models.","3":"208","4":"0.9945","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,1.647323431011023,0,1.0029595226955061,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0.7073318155519017,0,1.7798702043376429,0,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0,1.4354707293691626,0,1.9961028493586088,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.2457446338395524,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,0,2.0097508300035996,0,0.4781806025991309,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.2074668297749496,0,2.345516820536957,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,4.0634616560486405,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.5022688764205891,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,8,9,10,11,15,17,19,20,22,24,25,26,27,30,32,34,35,37,40,41,42,44,46,47,49,51,52,53,55,57,58,59,60,62,63,64,66,68,69,70,72,73,74,75,77,80,82,84,85,87,90,91,92,94,95,96,97,98,99,100],"values":[208,0.9945,0.5991182309116689,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,1.647323431011023,1.0029595226955061,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,1.5938879484831778,0.321098069371625,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0.5738004229273791,0.6037334148874748,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0.3018667074437374,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0.7073318155519017,1.7798702043376429,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0.8126923312097281,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,1.4354707293691626,1.9961028493586088,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.2457446338395524,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,2.0097508300035996,0.4781806025991309,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.2074668297749496,2.345516820536957,0.5131758011109443,0.7814397877056235,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0.6814130815200025,4.0634616560486405,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.5022688764205891,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822]},"7":"7.988078599064024","index":13},{"0":"Anker Soundcore Sport X10","1":"The Soundcore Sport X10 have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks that flip up when you're using them and flip down when you want to set them in their charging case, which has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. As long as you get a tight seal, they sound good, with powerful, punchy bass and good detail.

That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads.The HX have custom 40mm drivers, Bluetooth 5.1 and support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive (that includes AptX HD) for high-resolution wireless streaming when you combine an aptX-enabled Android device with certain music-streaming services like Qobuz.Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound, overall well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. If you want to push the treble or bass, you can tweak the EQ in the Bang & Olufsen app for iOS and Android and give the headphones a warmer or brighter profile. Their noise canceling is also very good and voice-calling capabilities are also quite solid. Additionally, they offer multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them with a smartphone and PC simultaneously (Microsoft Swift Pair-enabled for Windows machines) so you can easily switch between the two. Battery life is rated at up to 35 hours with noise canceling on and 40 hours with it off.Earlier Bang & Olufsen models included a soft case (a pouch really), but the HX headphones come with a hard case. As I said, they're expensive, but the small improvements over earlier flagship Bang & Olufsen noise-canceling headphones help make the HX headphones a worthy alternative to the AirPods Max.","3":"311","4":"0.995","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,2.392451215615271,0,1.0500205175158943,4.476920235274207,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,0,1.4726387048503082,3.1254685865746485,1.7973546927350068,6.0401859137070835,1.8255515795334214,0.5014797613477531,0,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,1.9596757557867082,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.64219613874325,3.9547226936246247,0,1.7591376154027176,0,1.539527403332833,5.738004229273791,2.298329135661882,0.9056001223312122,2.04800284975387,1.875281151944789,7.032958089350611,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,1.0438040521731147,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0,3.7267649726908587,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0,0.9493127452246646,0.7073318155519017,0,1.2240432714951537,1.4354707293691626,1.4726387048503082,0.6653676164528696,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.3114361584598881,0,2.0626613766562842,1.2240432714951537,0,1.3862943611198906,1.6078006640028795,0,0.11954515064978273,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0,4.596658271323764,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,0.40195016600071987,2.5658790055547214,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,2.438076993629184,2.3443193631168704,2.980182309603068,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,1.6253846624194561,0.7214144149333415,0,0,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,1.1476008458547582,0,4.754126570096438]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[311,0.995,0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,2.392451215615271,0,1.0500205175158943,4.476920235274207,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,0,1.4726387048503082,3.1254685865746485,1.7973546927350068,6.0401859137070835,1.8255515795334214,0.5014797613477531,0,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,1.9596757557867082,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.64219613874325,3.9547226936246247,0,1.7591376154027176,0,1.539527403332833,5.738004229273791,2.298329135661882,0.9056001223312122,2.04800284975387,1.875281151944789,7.032958089350611,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,1.0438040521731147,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0,3.7267649726908587,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0,0.9493127452246646,0.7073318155519017,0,1.2240432714951537,1.4354707293691626,1.4726387048503082,0.6653676164528696,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.3114361584598881,0,2.0626613766562842,1.2240432714951537,0,1.3862943611198906,1.6078006640028795,0,0.11954515064978273,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0,4.596658271323764,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,0.40195016600071987,2.5658790055547214,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,2.438076993629184,2.3443193631168704,2.980182309603068,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,1.6253846624194561,0.7214144149333415,0,0,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,1.1476008458547582,0,4.754126570096438]},"7":"8.01099742182878","index":16},{"0":"Baseus Bowie MA10","1":"Priced at just $28 after you click an instant 20% discount coupon on Amazon, the Baseus Bowie MA10 delivers surprisingly good sound along with active noise canceling for its low price (you just don't see too many active noise canceling earbuds at this price).

I also liked that their case is relatively compact for this type of ear-hook style earbud and they come with a detachable neckband like some competitors. Voice-calling performance is also pretty good, though not great. Note that they're available in a few different colors, but Amazon currently only has them in black.","3":"164","4":"0.8759","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0,1.7907680941096826,0,0,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,0,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0.6931471805599453,0.4671906878691208,0.9798378778933541,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,0,0,1.6841337087864658,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.2501874346298594,1.2074668297749496,0,0,0.4449675510844107,0,0,0,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,0,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0,1.5323446311496702,0,0.6228723169197762,1.303523928794182,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0,0.40195016600071987,0,0.23909030129956546,0,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,0,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,1.0263516022218886,0,0.7814397877056235,0,2.438076993629184,1.562879575411247,1.490091154801534,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9484938723687899,1.6253846624194561,0.36070720746667073,0,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,0,0.8680769611044408,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,11,12,13,14,18,19,20,21,28,29,30,31,32,33,36,37,40,41,44,50,51,53,54,55,56,58,60,61,62,63,64,66,68,70,71,72,74,75,76,77,79,80,82,84,85,86,87,89,90,91,93,94,96,99,100],"values":[164,0.8759,1.1982364618233379,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,1.7907680941096826,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,0.9484938723687899,0.6931471805599453,0.4671906878691208,0.9798378778933541,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,1.6841337087864658,0.6037334148874748,1.2501874346298594,1.2074668297749496,0.4449675510844107,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,1.5323446311496702,0.6228723169197762,1.303523928794182,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0.40195016600071987,0.23909030129956546,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,0.40195016600071987,1.0263516022218886,0.7814397877056235,2.438076993629184,1.562879575411247,1.490091154801534,0.34070654076000123,0.9484938723687899,1.6253846624194561,0.36070720746667073,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,0.8680769611044408,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822]},"7":"8.460146416605461","index":18},{"0":"Beats Powerbeats Pro","1":"The Beats Powerbeats Pro earbuds have been on the market for a few years but remain popular and are now available in several color options.

The new DT 700 X is easier to drive than the 770 Pro, thanks to the company's new STELLAR.45 sound transducer with an impedance of 48 ohms, so it plays better with smartphones, tablets and laptops without requiring a headphone amp.The headphone is targeted at content creators who want accurate audio reproduction, but it's a bit more dynamic sounding and less bass-shy than many studio headphones, which tend to restrain the bass and hew toward a very neutral sound profile. The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in. This closed-back version is more versatile.","3":"247","4":"0.9423","5":{"type":1,"values":[2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,3.8279219449844337,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,1.875281151944789,1.1982364618233379,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,1.4015720636073625,0.9798378778933541,2.3908319227247667,1.2669476034873244,1.605490346858125,0,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0,5.219020260865573,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,2.2248377554220538,1.0213867672353782,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0,0.4340384805522204,0,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.5571807922994405,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0,2.772588722239781,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.7172709038986964,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.1716374236829996,1.8112002446624245,0,1.7591376154027176,2.16925209338674,0.40195016600071987,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,0,1.703532703800006,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,2.2534033146308836,0.36070720746667073,2.2952016917095164,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[247,0.9423,2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,3.8279219449844337,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,1.875281151944789,1.1982364618233379,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,1.4015720636073625,0.9798378778933541,2.3908319227247667,1.2669476034873244,1.605490346858125,0,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0,5.219020260865573,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,2.2248377554220538,1.0213867672353782,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0,0.4340384805522204,0,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.5571807922994405,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0,2.772588722239781,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.7172709038986964,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.1716374236829996,1.8112002446624245,0,1.7591376154027176,2.16925209338674,0.40195016600071987,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,0,1.703532703800006,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,2.2534033146308836,0.36070720746667073,2.2952016917095164,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.54562143812672","index":20},{"0":"Beyerdynamic Xelento Wireless (2nd Generation)","1":"If you're willing to spend a lot of money, Beyerdynamic's 2nd-Generation Xelento Wireless earbuds deliver fantastic sound quality. Note that these can be used wired or wireless, with the buds detaching from the Bluetooth 5.2 neckband so you can use them with the included traditional 3.5mm jack cable (included). Equipped with Berydynamic's 11mm Tesla.11 drivers, the Xelento Wireless earbuds are special because of how clean and clear they sound, with no distortion and tight, well-defined bass that has excellent extension. They're very accurate sounding. What's also nice is that the earbuds come with 10 ear tips of varying sizes, as well as a mix of silicone and foam tips (I was able to get a tight seal with the 3XL size ear tips). The neckband has a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and amplifier courtesy of AKM, and there's support for Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec for Android and other devices that support it (the LHDC codec is also supported). Like some other high-end earbuds, these feature an ear-monitor design similar to what musicians use, with the cable wrapping around the top of your ear.","3":"182","4":"0.9803","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0,0,0,1.0500205175158943,2.686152141164524,0,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,0,3.7939754894751596,3.4657359027997265,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,0,1.2669476034873244,0.963294208114875,0,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,0,0.6037334148874748,2.04800284975387,0,0.7814397877056235,2.245511611715288,0,0,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0,0.5106933836176891,0,0,0.8489946694180636,0,0,0.7119845589184984,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0,1.469756816840031,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,2.16925209338674,0.40195016600071987,0,0,0,2.5073988067387654,0,1.562879575411247,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,0,1.442828829866683,0,0,0.6326847877140319,0,0.4340384805522204,0,1.8035360373333535,1.1476008458547582,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,6,7,11,12,13,18,19,20,21,23,24,28,29,30,32,33,35,36,41,42,43,45,48,51,52,53,55,56,57,59,60,62,63,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,77,78,79,83,85,87,88,91,94,96,98,99,100,101],"values":[182,0.9803,1.0500205175158943,2.686152141164524,1.2501874346298594,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,3.7939754894751596,3.4657359027997265,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,1.2669476034873244,0.963294208114875,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,0.6037334148874748,2.04800284975387,0.7814397877056235,2.245511611715288,0.6037334148874748,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0.5106933836176891,0.8489946694180636,0.7119845589184984,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.4354707293691626,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,1.469756816840031,0.3114361584598881,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,0.9056001223312122,0.5863792051342392,2.16925209338674,0.40195016600071987,2.5073988067387654,1.562879575411247,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,1.442828829866683,0.6326847877140319,0.4340384805522204,1.8035360373333535,1.1476008458547582,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.094056279448989","index":21},{"0":"Bose Frames (Tempo)","1":"The Bose Frames are one of those products you have to try in order to fully appreciate -- or dismiss. The concept is that you're getting a decent pair of sunglasses with a pair of headphones that don't actually go in your ears. Rather, integrated micro speakers in each arm direct a beam of sound to your ears. That design could be appealing to people who don't like having headphones in or on their ears and also offers a degree of safety for runners and bikers who want their ears open to the world.Bose has updated its line of audio sunglasses with three new models, including the Tempo sports model, which offers better sound and battery life than the more traditional-looking Tenor and Soprano. The Tempo has better specs all around, with USB-C charging and larger 22mm drivers. It also delivers up to 8 hours of battery life.Their sound is definitely improved from the original Frames. Bose says the Tempo plays \"deeper and louder -- loud enough for cycling at 25 mph -- while [you're] still able to hear traffic and your training partners.\" They're sweat-, weather-, scratch- and shatter-resistant, according to Bose, and fit under most protective helmets. (I had no problem using them with a couple of bike helmets.) They also work really well for making calls, thanks to a new dual-microphone system. Optional lenses are available for $39 and you can order prescription lenses through Lensabl.","3":"238","4":"0.9673","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,0,0,2.3964729236466757,1.0982156206740152,1.8255515795334214,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.321098069371625,1.318240897874875,2.886882212016005,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,1.539527403332833,0,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.9056001223312122,2.1219954466557054,0,0.4449675510844107,2.0427735344707565,1.6573853451123386,0,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,4.243990893311411,1.7361539222088815,0,0,0,0,0.7661723155748351,1.469756816840031,0.6228723169197762,0,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,2.0794415416798357,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,0,0,1.0045833390198333,0,0,0,0,1.318240897874875,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,1.2058504980021596,1.539527403332833,0,0,0,4.0634616560486405,0.7814397877056235,2.980182309603068,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0,1.6253846624194561,0.36070720746667073,0,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,0]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[238,0.9673,0.5991182309116689,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,0,0,2.3964729236466757,1.0982156206740152,1.8255515795334214,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.321098069371625,1.318240897874875,2.886882212016005,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,1.539527403332833,0,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.9056001223312122,2.1219954466557054,0,0.4449675510844107,2.0427735344707565,1.6573853451123386,0,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,4.243990893311411,1.7361539222088815,0,0,0,0,0.7661723155748351,1.469756816840031,0.6228723169197762,0,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,2.0794415416798357,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,0,0,1.0045833390198333,0,0,0,0,1.318240897874875,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,1.2058504980021596,1.539527403332833,0,0,0,4.0634616560486405,0.7814397877056235,2.980182309603068,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0,1.6253846624194561,0.36070720746667073,0,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,0]},"7":"9.101659385764526","index":22},{"0":"Bose QuietComfort 45","1":"The QuietComfort 45 has virtually the same design as its predecessor, the QuietComfort QC35 II, which many people consider one of the most comfortable over-ear headphones -- if not the most comfortable. It has the same drivers, and the buttons are in the same place. There are small but notable changes. First, we're pleased that these have a USB-C charging port instead of Micro-USB. Secondly, the microphone configuration is different. Not only have the mics been shifted, but there's now an additional external microphone for voice pick-up, which means the QC45 has a total of six mics, four of which are beamforming and used for voice. By contrast, the QC35 II has four, two of which are used for voice. (The Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 also have six microphones total.)These headphones are excellent for making calls. They're similar to the Bose Headphones 700 in that regard. They also include top-notch noise canceling and multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can connect them with a PC and your phone simultaneously. Read our full review of the QuietComfort 45.","3":"173","4":"0.9259","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,2.3359534393456043,0,0,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,0,1.9336860220739729,0,1.875281151944789,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,1.5044392840432592,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.4671906878691208,0,0.7969439742415889,0,0.963294208114875,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,0.5106933836176891,0,0,1.131992892557418,0,0,0.9493127452246646,1.4146636311038034,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0,0,0,0,0,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0,0.6931471805599453,0,0,0.23909030129956546,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0,1.0029595226955061,0,0,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,1.562879575411247,0,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0,0,0.6326847877140319,0,0,0,0,1.7214012687821372,0,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,3,6,7,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,24,26,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,40,41,45,48,51,52,53,54,55,56,62,63,65,68,75,77,80,81,83,86,87,88,90,91,94,99],"values":[173,0.9259,2.3359534393456043,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,1.9336860220739729,1.875281151944789,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,1.5044392840432592,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.4671906878691208,0.7969439742415889,0.963294208114875,0.7217205530040013,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,0.5106933836176891,1.131992892557418,0.9493127452246646,1.4146636311038034,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.6931471805599453,0.23909030129956546,0.6037334148874748,0.5863792051342392,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,1.0029595226955061,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,1.562879575411247,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0.6326847877140319,1.7214012687821372]},"7":"8.67397873064734","index":23},{"0":"Bose QuietComfort Headphones","1":"When Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a new, slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the very comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations and that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). The QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling, and strong voice-calling performance.  As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \"visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \"help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com. While the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than over the course of the year -- so look to buy them when they're on sale. You can read our review of the QuietComfort 45 to get a good take on the QuietComfort Headphones.","3":"283","4":"0.9843","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0,0.5250102587579472,0,1.362826163040005,3.8673720441479458,2.9566054321474167,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,2.1964312413480305,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,1.4015720636073625,0,1.5938879484831778,0,1.92658841622975,1.318240897874875,0,1.7591376154027176,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0,0.9855351440491389,6.876030890464227,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.4449675510844107,1.2767334590442228,3.314770690224677,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,1.1727584102684785,0.9493127452246646,2.1219954466557054,1.7361539222088815,3.060108178737884,0.4784902431230542,2.9452774097006165,1.3307352329057391,0,1.9596757557867082,1.2457446338395524,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0,0.8489946694180636,1.0045833390198333,0,0,1.1716374236829996,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.539527403332833,3.072004274630805,2.3443193631168704,0,1.6253846624194561,0.7814397877056235,0,1.703532703800006,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0.36070720746667073,0,1.562879575411247,1.0544746461900532,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[283,0.9843,0,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0,0.5250102587579472,0,1.362826163040005,3.8673720441479458,2.9566054321474167,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,2.1964312413480305,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,1.4015720636073625,0,1.5938879484831778,0,1.92658841622975,1.318240897874875,0,1.7591376154027176,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0,0.9855351440491389,6.876030890464227,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.4449675510844107,1.2767334590442228,3.314770690224677,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,1.1727584102684785,0.9493127452246646,2.1219954466557054,1.7361539222088815,3.060108178737884,0.4784902431230542,2.9452774097006165,1.3307352329057391,0,1.9596757557867082,1.2457446338395524,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0,0.8489946694180636,1.0045833390198333,0,0,1.1716374236829996,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.539527403332833,3.072004274630805,2.3443193631168704,0,1.6253846624194561,0.7814397877056235,0,1.703532703800006,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0.36070720746667073,0,1.562879575411247,1.0544746461900532,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"9.291427034645329","index":24},{"0":"Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2e","1":"Bowers & Wilkins released the PX7 S2 headphones in 2022 with some significant improvements over the first-generation version. And now it's put out a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e with the \"e\" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been returned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip.These headphones are more comfortable than the original PX7s -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- and not only sound better but have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. The PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers excellent sound. Bowers & Wilkins also sell a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more.","3":"150","4":"0.9434","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,2.3359534393456043,0,0.7511344382102946,0,0,1.0221196222800037,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.1964312413480305,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,0,3.072004274630805,0.6250937173149297,0,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,0,0.9855351440491389,3.1254685865746485,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,1.2767334590442228,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0,0.9493127452246646,0,1.3021154416566612,1.8360649072427306,0.4784902431230542,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,1.5323446311496702,0,0.3114361584598881,0,0,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.23909030129956546,0,0,1.0045833390198333,0,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,1.08462604669337,0,0.5131758011109443,0,0.7814397877056235,0,1.6253846624194561,0.7814397877056235,2.980182309603068,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0,0,0,0.36070720746667073,0,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,15,18,20,21,22,30,31,33,34,36,37,39,40,41,45,46,47,48,49,51,53,54,55,56,57,58,60,63,64,66,67,68,71,73,75,78,80,82,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,94,98,100],"values":[150,0.9434,2.3359534393456043,0.7511344382102946,1.0221196222800037,2.1964312413480305,0.9484938723687899,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,3.072004274630805,0.6250937173149297,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,0.9855351440491389,3.1254685865746485,0.6037334148874748,1.2767334590442228,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.9493127452246646,1.3021154416566612,1.8360649072427306,0.4784902431230542,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,1.5323446311496702,0.3114361584598881,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.23909030129956546,1.0045833390198333,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.08462604669337,0.5131758011109443,0.7814397877056235,1.6253846624194561,0.7814397877056235,2.980182309603068,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0.4217898584760213,0.36070720746667073,0.561377902928822]},"7":"8.671267921390667","index":25},{"0":"Bowers & Wilkins PX8","1":"When they were originally announced, Bowers & Wilkins' swanky PX8 noise-canceling headphones were supposed to cost $549 or essentially the same price as Apple's AirPod Max headphones. When they finally hit stores, the PX8's price jumped to $699 or a full $300 more than the company's step-down PX7 S2 headphones, which are also excellent (see below).The biggest difference between the PX8, which weigh in at 320 grams, and the PX7 S2 are the PX8's all-new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are \"inspired\" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 Series loudspeaker line. Bowers & Wilkins says these units help deliver superior resolution, detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the PX7 S2.Based on my tests, that's true. While I liked the PX7 S2, the PX8 headphones do sound more special, with a touch more openness and overall clarity. They're right near the top for sound in Bluetooth headphones and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions (there's no listening fatigue with these guys). For the best sound, you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USB-C to USB-C cable. As for the noise-canceling function, it's good but not quite on par with what you get from Sony's WH-1000XM5. And while the voice-calling capabilities are solid, these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls (the transparency mode is top-notch). While I can't say they're worth $300 more than the PX7 S2, they're a great set of cans if you can afford them. I do prefer the sound and overall performance of the more expensive Focal Bathys, though the Bathys don't have such strong noise canceling, but the PX8 headphones are a close second.","3":"295","4":"0.9757","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.6250937173149297,0,2.745539051685038,0,2.0059190453910123,2.84548161710637,0.6931471805599453,1.8687627514764833,0,0.7969439742415889,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,1.7591376154027176,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,2.2952016917095164,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,6.14400854926161,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0,1.875281151944789,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,3.314770690224677,0,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,0,0.9493127452246646,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,1.303523928794182,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,3.4657359027997265,2.0097508300035996,0.6791609385852054,0.7172709038986964,0,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.6037334148874748,1.318240897874875,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,0,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,0,1.0221196222800037,3.125759150822494,0.9484938723687899,3.2507693248389122,0.36070720746667073,3.4428025375642743,1.562879575411247,0.6326847877140319,1.3583218771704109,0,3.755672191051473,0,1.7214012687821372,1.6841337087864658,0]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[295,0.9757,1.1982364618233379,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.6250937173149297,0,2.745539051685038,0,2.0059190453910123,2.84548161710637,0.6931471805599453,1.8687627514764833,0,0.7969439742415889,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,1.7591376154027176,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,2.2952016917095164,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,6.14400854926161,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0,1.875281151944789,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,3.314770690224677,0,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,0,0.9493127452246646,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,1.303523928794182,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,3.4657359027997265,2.0097508300035996,0.6791609385852054,0.7172709038986964,0,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.6037334148874748,1.318240897874875,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,0,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,0,1.0221196222800037,3.125759150822494,0.9484938723687899,3.2507693248389122,0.36070720746667073,3.4428025375642743,1.562879575411247,0.6326847877140319,1.3583218771704109,0,3.755672191051473,0,1.7214012687821372,1.6841337087864658,0]},"7":"7.98938716947343","index":26},{"0":"Cleer Audio Arc 2 Sport","1":"Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. This new-for-2023 model steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new \"enhanced\" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which makes for a significantly improved product.Cleer says the Arc 2 Sport buds feature \"greater flexibility for improved comfort,\" and I did find them more comfortable to wear than the original Arcs. That said, not everyone loves this style of open earbuds, which lets sound in so you can hear ambient sound around you for safety purposes.With a new six-axis motion sensor, you can actually control the buds with head gestures -- you answer calls by nodding and skip tracks forward by turning your head to the right and skip a track back by turning your head left. Thankfully, those motion controls can be turned off if you don't want to use them. These are among the first buds to support Qualcomm's aptX Lossless format, if you're one of the few to have an Android device that supports that audio codec (plenty of Android phones support aptX Adaptive). Since these aren't high-end noise-isolating earbuds, you probably won't be able to tell the difference in sound quality -- I couldn't -- but all that aside, these do sound very good for open-style earbuds. They lack a bit of oomph to their bass but they're punchy enough, offer good clarity and didn't distort at higher volumes. They also played sufficiently loud. They have an IPX5 water- and sweat-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water, and battery life is very good at up to eight hours on a single charge, plus there's a little more than three additional charges in the slim but still somewhat bulky charging case. It's big compared to an AirPods charging case, but svelte compared to other cases that house this style of earbuds.These offer respectable performance for voice calls, but callers did say they heard a certain amount of white noise when I spoke to them from the noisy streets of New York -- that whooshing sound is the by-product of the earbuds' noise-reduction efforts.","3":"379","4":"0.9883","5":{"type":1,"values":[2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,2.2534033146308836,0,0,1.0221196222800037,0,1.9710702880982778,1.875281151944789,2.2089580572754626,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,0.5491078103370076,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0,1.2669476034873244,0.64219613874325,0,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,1.1476008458547582,0,0.9056001223312122,1.024001424876935,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,1.122755805857644,1.509333537218687,2.0876081043462293,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,1.8112002446624245,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,1.7798702043376429,1.5320801508530675,0,3.8673720441479458,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,0.5863792051342392,1.1866409315308308,2.1219954466557054,2.6042308833133223,1.8360649072427306,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,1.2457446338395524,1.303523928794182,2.0626613766562842,0,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,1.31499665714761,0,1.131992892557418,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,2.113066952106162,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,3.079054806665666,2.04800284975387,0,0.5014797613477531,3.2507693248389122,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.703532703800006,3.125759150822494,1.8969877447375798,0.8126923312097281,1.8035360373333535,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.8435797169520426,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0,2.5249504522666952,2.2952016917095164,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[379,0.9883,2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,2.2534033146308836,0,0,1.0221196222800037,0,1.9710702880982778,1.875281151944789,2.2089580572754626,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,0.5491078103370076,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0,1.2669476034873244,0.64219613874325,0,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,1.1476008458547582,0,0.9056001223312122,1.024001424876935,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,1.122755805857644,1.509333537218687,2.0876081043462293,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,1.8112002446624245,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,1.7798702043376429,1.5320801508530675,0,3.8673720441479458,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,0.5863792051342392,1.1866409315308308,2.1219954466557054,2.6042308833133223,1.8360649072427306,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,1.2457446338395524,1.303523928794182,2.0626613766562842,0,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,1.31499665714761,0,1.131992892557418,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,2.113066952106162,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,3.079054806665666,2.04800284975387,0,0.5014797613477531,3.2507693248389122,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.703532703800006,3.125759150822494,1.8969877447375798,0.8126923312097281,1.8035360373333535,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.8435797169520426,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0,2.5249504522666952,2.2952016917095164,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"7.9391142713105465","index":27},{"0":"Creative Sound Blaster Jam V2","1":"I was a fan of Creative's original Sound Blaster Jam headphones that came out in 2015 and had a decidedly retro look and feel, with good sound for the money. Now they're available in a 2.0 version that has some key upgrades, including Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C charging, improved call quality and multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to pair it to two devices simultaneously. Battery life is rated at up to 22 hours.I was able to pair this wireless headphone set with a Mac Mini and an iPhone 12 Pro and then switch audio between them. Often when pairing Bluetooth headphones with Mac and Windows PCs, one can encounter some issues, but once I got the headphones paired with both my PC and phone, they made a good pair of work-from-home headphones. Also, the price is right for parents looking for a decent set of kids' headphones for remote learning and everyday use.Comfortable for on-ear headphones, the Jam V2s are lightweight and have nicely balanced sound with good detail and bass that's ample but not overpowering. Call quality was good in my tests with callers saying they could hear me well even on the noisy streets of New York. No carry pouch is included, but you do get an extra set of foam ear pads, which is good, because they will wear out over time.The headphones have physical buttons for controlling volume and playback, and there's aptX support for devices that support the wireless streaming codec.","3":"244","4":"0.9841","5":{"type":1,"values":[2.3964729236466757,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,2.2089580572754626,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,2.1964312413480305,0.9127757897667107,1.5044392840432592,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,1.4015720636073625,0,0,0,0,0,1.4434411060080026,1.1727584102684785,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,0.5738004229273791,5.745822839154705,0.6037334148874748,1.024001424876935,2.5003748692597187,0,1.6841337087864658,0.9056001223312122,0,0,1.875281151944789,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,2.2248377554220538,0.5106933836176891,1.6573853451123386,0,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0,0.23732818630616614,0,0.4340384805522204,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0,1.9596757557867082,0,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0,0,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,1.3583218771704109,0.3586354519493482,0,1.131992892557418,0,0,1.149164567830941,2.3432748473659992,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,3.0088785680865184,0.8126923312097281,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0.5738004229273791,1.562879575411247,0,1.3583218771704109,1.3021154416566612,1.5022688764205891,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,1.6841337087864658,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[244,0.9841,2.3964729236466757,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,2.2089580572754626,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,2.1964312413480305,0.9127757897667107,1.5044392840432592,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,1.4015720636073625,0,0,0,0,0,1.4434411060080026,1.1727584102684785,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,0.5738004229273791,5.745822839154705,0.6037334148874748,1.024001424876935,2.5003748692597187,0,1.6841337087864658,0.9056001223312122,0,0,1.875281151944789,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,2.2248377554220538,0.5106933836176891,1.6573853451123386,0,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0,0.23732818630616614,0,0.4340384805522204,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0,1.9596757557867082,0,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0,0,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,1.3583218771704109,0.3586354519493482,0,1.131992892557418,0,0,1.149164567830941,2.3432748473659992,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,3.0088785680865184,0.8126923312097281,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0.5738004229273791,1.562879575411247,0,1.3583218771704109,1.3021154416566612,1.5022688764205891,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,1.6841337087864658,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"7.859757391863136","index":28},{"0":"Cyber Acoustics Essential Bluetooth Headset HS-2000BT","1":"UC headsets that include a USB dongle so you can easily connect the headset wirelessly to your computer tend to cost more than headsets that just feature Bluetooth connectivity. Listing for around $130, the Cyber Acoustics Essential Bluetooth Headset HS-2000BT sells at a discount compared to similarly styled models from Jabra and Poly. I'm not going to say the HS-2000BT is better than those models, but it's lightweight and comfortable to wear and offers similar features, including a retractable boom microphone with automatic muting (when you retract the boom mic). It also has a couple of bonus features: active noise canceling and wireless charging (Qi wireless charging pad not included). Callers said I sounded good though not quite as clear as when I was using the Logitech Zone Vibe 100. I thought the HS-2000BT sounded good when using them to listen to music, though the sound is on the warmer side (pushes the bass a bit). The headset is worth checking out, particularly if it goes on sale.","3":"167","4":"0.9783","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,1.4015720636073625,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,0,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,0.7363193524251541,1.2501874346298594,0,0.5491078103370076,0,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0.9343813757382416,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.963294208114875,2.63648179574975,0,0,0,0,0,1.149164567830941,0,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.4146636311038034,0,0,0.5106933836176891,3.314770690224677,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,2.829327262207607,1.3021154416566612,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,1.5323446311496702,1.469756816840031,0.3114361584598881,0,0.8250645506625137,0,0.7073318155519017,0,0,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0,0.565996446278709,0,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,0,0,1.024001424876935,0,2.0059190453910123,1.6253846624194561,0,1.490091154801534,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0,1.442828829866683,1.7214012687821372,0,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,15,17,20,22,24,25,31,35,36,37,40,42,45,46,47,48,50,51,52,53,54,55,57,58,59,60,62,64,67,68,70,72,73,75,81,83,84,86,87,88,92,93,94,95,96,98,99],"values":[167,0.9783,0.5991182309116689,1.4015720636073625,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,0.7363193524251541,1.2501874346298594,0.5491078103370076,0.5014797613477531,0.9343813757382416,1.5938879484831778,0.963294208114875,2.63648179574975,1.149164567830941,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0.6250937173149297,1.4146636311038034,0.5106933836176891,3.314770690224677,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,2.829327262207607,1.3021154416566612,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0.6653676164528696,1.5323446311496702,1.469756816840031,0.3114361584598881,0.8250645506625137,0.7073318155519017,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0.565996446278709,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,2.0059190453910123,1.6253846624194561,1.490091154801534,0.6814130815200025,0.7814397877056235,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.442828829866683,1.7214012687821372]},"7":"8.348148077926654","index":29},{"0":"Earfun Air Pro 3","1":"Earfun has put out a series of wireless earbuds over the last couple of years with one important commonality: They're very good values, made more so by frequent discounts. The company's Earfun Air Pro 3 earbuds feature the a Qualcomm QCC3071 system-on-a-chip with AptX Adaptive for Android and other devices that support the new LE Audio standard and LC3 audio codec, which is superior to the SBC codec (they also support AAC for Apple devices).Lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- these aren't a huge upgrade over the Earfun Air S, but they are better. They have slightly larger wool-composite drivers (11mm versus 10mm), slightly improved noise canceling and better battery life (up to seven hours with noise canceling on, according to Earfun).In short, the Earfun Air 3 deliver strong performance for their modest price, with robust bass, good clarity and a relatively wide soundstage. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and \"multidevice\" connectivity. (I could pair them to two devices simultaneously but had to pause the music on one device and hit play on the other for the audio to switch.) They're IPX5 splash-proof and also work well (though not exceptionally well) as a headset for making calls. Use the code EAP3CNET at checkout at Amazon to drop the price to just less than $55.","3":"227","4":"0.9919","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,1.8687627514764833,0.9569804862461084,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0,0,0,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.64219613874325,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0,1.539527403332833,2.2952016917095164,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,0,0.6250937173149297,3.125759150822494,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.5106933836176891,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,1.4146636311038034,2.6042308833133223,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,0,0,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,0.8039003320014397,0,0,1.9336860220739729,1.131992892557418,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.9056001223312122,1.318240897874875,0,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,0,2.5073988067387654,1.6253846624194561,0,1.490091154801534,0,0,0.9484938723687899,2.438076993629184,1.442828829866683,0,0,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,1.7361539222088815,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[227,0.9919,0.5991182309116689,1.8687627514764833,0.9569804862461084,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0,0,0,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.64219613874325,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0,1.539527403332833,2.2952016917095164,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,0,0.6250937173149297,3.125759150822494,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.5106933836176891,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,1.4146636311038034,2.6042308833133223,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,0,0,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,0.8039003320014397,0,0,1.9336860220739729,1.131992892557418,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.9056001223312122,1.318240897874875,0,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,0,2.5073988067387654,1.6253846624194561,0,1.490091154801534,0,0,0.9484938723687899,2.438076993629184,1.442828829866683,0,0,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,1.7361539222088815,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.448214595132107","index":30},{"0":"Earfun Air S","1":"In the past, we've recommended Earfun's AirPro SV and  as excellent budget noise-canceling earbuds choices (they're still good values). But the new-for-2022 Earfun Air S may be the best of the trio, with multipoint Bluetooth pairing, the latest Qualcomm QCC3046 SoC (system on a chip) with the AptX audio codec for Android and other devices that support it. It has the same 10mm wool drivers as the AirPro SV and features surprisingly impressive sound for its modest price point. They also work well as a headset for making calls with decent background noise reduction.The buds have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they're splashproof and can withstand a sustained spray of water. Note that the earbuds cost as low as $58 when you activate the instant coupon at checkout at Amazon.","3":"130","4":"0.9731","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0,0,0,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7363193524251541,1.2501874346298594,0.5991182309116689,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,1.4015720636073625,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0,0,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0,1.7361539222088815,0,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0,0.6931471805599453,0.8039003320014397,0,0.11954515064978273,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.875281151944789,0,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0,0.5131758011109443,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0.8126923312097281,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0,3.0045377528411783,0.36070720746667073,0,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,7,8,11,12,13,14,17,19,20,21,24,27,29,34,35,40,41,44,45,46,47,48,50,51,53,55,56,57,59,62,63,65,66,68,70,72,74,75,77,78,80,83,85,87,90,91,92,93,94,95,97,98,100],"values":[130,0.9731,0.5991182309116689,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,1.2501874346298594,0.7363193524251541,1.2501874346298594,0.5991182309116689,0.5014797613477531,0.6931471805599453,1.4015720636073625,0.48991893894667704,0.321098069371625,0.5863792051342392,1.0263516022218886,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,1.7361539222088815,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0.48991893894667704,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.6931471805599453,0.8039003320014397,0.11954515064978273,0.2829982231393545,1.875281151944789,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.5131758011109443,0.5014797613477531,0.7814397877056235,0.34070654076000123,0.8126923312097281,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,3.0045377528411783,0.36070720746667073,0.561377902928822]},"7":"8.340484918116422","index":31},{"0":"Earfun Free 2S","1":"I was a fan of the original Earfun Free 2 buds, which have been subsequently upgraded to the 2S (it now comes in a new, slightly updated version).

While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose, Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models) and offer respectable noise canceling and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less.They're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphones and other devices that support that protocol. I also like that they come with a hard case and a cable for wired listening (though noise-canceling is disabled when you go wired, which is a bit of a bummer).","3":"186","4":"0.9705","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0.4671906878691208,0.9569804862461084,0.7511344382102946,0,0,0,0.9668430110369864,0,0,0,0,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0,0,0,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,1.318240897874875,0,1.1727584102684785,0,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6037334148874748,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.3349026532532322,0,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,0,0.7119845589184984,0.7073318155519017,1.3021154416566612,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,1.8360649072427306,0,0.6931471805599453,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,0.23909030129956546,1.9336860220739729,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0,1.8969877447375798,1.6253846624194561,1.442828829866683,2.2952016917095164,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,0,1.442828829866683,0,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,9,14,15,19,20,22,24,25,27,29,30,32,34,35,37,40,41,44,46,47,48,49,51,52,53,55,59,60,61,62,63,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,78,79,81,82,83,87,89,90,91,92,93,94,96,98,100],"values":[186,0.9705,1.1982364618233379,0.4671906878691208,0.9569804862461084,0.7511344382102946,0.9668430110369864,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,1.5938879484831778,0.321098069371625,1.318240897874875,1.1727584102684785,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,0.6037334148874748,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.3018667074437374,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,1.3349026532532322,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,0.7119845589184984,0.7073318155519017,1.3021154416566612,0.4784902431230542,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,1.8360649072427306,0.6931471805599453,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,0.23909030129956546,1.9336860220739729,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0.9056001223312122,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0.6814130815200025,1.8969877447375798,1.6253846624194561,1.442828829866683,2.2952016917095164,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.8680769611044408,1.442828829866683,0.561377902928822]},"7":"8.235866744584435","index":33},{"0":"Edifier W820NB Plus","1":"Edifier makes some good-sounding PC speakers and true-wireless earbuds and it's done a nice job with its W820NB noise-canceling headphones, now on their second-gen version, the Edifier W820NB Plus. The first thing you'll notice about them when you put them on is that they're comfortable. Edifier has upgraded the ear pads with higher-grade memory foam, and the headphones fit snugly on your head. They also sound pretty good for their price, offering slightly improved audio quality from the originals, thanks to what appear to be upgraded drivers (also, they now support the LDAC audio codec for Android devices). You get a bit more clarity and a slightly better bass definition. Their sound didn't necessarily blow me away -- they lack a bit of openness -- but it's very good for what the headphones cost. Like their predecessor, they're pleasant-sounding headphones  (even a bit more so now). Other features include an ambient mode that lets outside sound in and a low-latency gaming mode. The noise canceling has been upgraded slightly, and they're decent for voice calling. Battery life is pretty impressive, with up to 49 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels (and noise canceling off). A couple of things are still missing: There's no carrying case or headphone jack, although it can connect them to your computer with the included USB-C to USB-A cable. The 820NB Plus headphones are still a good value.","3":"237","4":"0.9856","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,1.8687627514764833,0.9569804862461084,2.2534033146308836,1.0500205175158943,0,0.34070654076000123,1.9336860220739729,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,1.7973546927350068,2.745539051685038,0,0.5014797613477531,1.8969877447375798,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,1.9596757557867082,0,0,0,0,0,1.1727584102684785,1.4726387048503082,0,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0.9056001223312122,0,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.7660400754265337,0,0,0.565996446278709,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,1.3021154416566612,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,2.4495946947333853,1.2457446338395524,1.303523928794182,0.8250645506625137,0,0,0,0.8039003320014397,0,0.4781806025991309,0.9668430110369864,1.6979893388361271,0,1.2501874346298594,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,0,1.2058504980021596,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0,2.438076993629184,0,1.490091154801534,0.34070654076000123,1.562879575411247,0,0.8126923312097281,2.1642432448000246,1.1476008458547582,0,0.21089492923801065,2.037482815755616,0.4340384805522204,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11,14,15,17,18,19,20,21,27,28,32,35,36,37,39,41,43,44,45,48,50,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,66,68,69,70,72,73,74,75,77,79,80,81,82,84,86,87,88,90,91,92,94,95,96,98,99,100],"values":[237,0.9856,1.1982364618233379,1.8687627514764833,0.9569804862461084,2.2534033146308836,1.0500205175158943,0.34070654076000123,1.9336860220739729,0.6250937173149297,1.7973546927350068,2.745539051685038,0.5014797613477531,1.8969877447375798,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,1.9596757557867082,1.1727584102684785,1.4726387048503082,0.9056001223312122,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,1.2074668297749496,0.9855351440491389,0.9056001223312122,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.7660400754265337,0.565996446278709,0.5863792051342392,1.3021154416566612,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,2.4495946947333853,1.2457446338395524,1.303523928794182,0.8250645506625137,0.8039003320014397,0.4781806025991309,0.9668430110369864,1.6979893388361271,1.2501874346298594,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0.5863792051342392,1.2058504980021596,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,2.438076993629184,1.490091154801534,0.34070654076000123,1.562879575411247,0.8126923312097281,2.1642432448000246,1.1476008458547582,0.21089492923801065,2.037482815755616,0.4340384805522204,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,0.561377902928822]},"7":"7.969501874578729","index":34},{"0":"Edifier WH500","1":"Available in three color options, there's nothing terribly fancy about the Edifier WH500 on-ear headphones.

They also have an Ambient Aware transparency mode and Talk Thru mode that can automatically lower your music's volume level and open up the buds to the outside world. That means you can have conversation with someone without removing the buds from your ears.They stayed on my ears very securely during runs and I thought they sounded quite good, though they do have a bit of bass push (i.e. they have powerful bass). Just be aware that if you don't get a tight seal, sound quality will be significantly worse. Also, like other earbuds with ear-hook designs, the case is on the beefy side. That said, the buds do seem durable and if you get a good fit, they're an excellent and less pricey alternative to the Beats Powerbeats Pro. I also thought the touch controls worked well; I was easily able to toggle through the sound modes.","3":"196","4":"0.9708","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0,0.5250102587579472,0,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,2.5003748692597187,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0.5491078103370076,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,0,0,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0.321098069371625,1.318240897874875,2.165161659012004,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,0,1.562879575411247,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,0,2.1219954466557054,0,0.8899351021688214,1.787426842661912,0,0,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0,0.4340384805522204,0,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,1.3307352329057391,0.7661723155748351,0,0.3114361584598881,2.607047857588364,1.2375968259937706,0,0.7073318155519017,0,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0,0.8489946694180636,0,0,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0,1.7591376154027176,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0,0.8126923312097281,1.562879575411247,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,1.0821216224000123,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,0,0.4340384805522204,2.2534033146308836,1.8035360373333535,0,1.6841337087864658,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,9,11,13,15,17,18,21,24,25,26,27,28,30,32,33,35,36,37,42,44,45,50,51,53,55,56,57,58,60,61,62,64,66,67,68,70,73,74,75,77,78,79,80,84,85,87,89,90,91,92,93,94,96,97,98,100,101],"values":[196,0.9708,0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0.5250102587579472,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,2.5003748692597187,1.2501874346298594,0.5491078103370076,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,0.48991893894667704,0.321098069371625,1.318240897874875,2.165161659012004,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,1.1476008458547582,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,1.562879575411247,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,2.1219954466557054,0.8899351021688214,1.787426842661912,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.4340384805522204,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,1.3307352329057391,0.7661723155748351,0.3114361584598881,2.607047857588364,1.2375968259937706,0.7073318155519017,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0.8489946694180636,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,1.7591376154027176,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0.8126923312097281,1.562879575411247,0.6814130815200025,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,1.0821216224000123,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,0.4340384805522204,2.2534033146308836,1.8035360373333535,1.6841337087864658,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.215114739542752","index":40},{"0":"JBL Live 770NC","1":"The well-designed and comfortable JBL Live 770NC offers some modest improvements over its predecessor, including better battery life (up to 65 hours with ANC off and 50 hours with ANC on) and Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio (via a future firmware upgrade).

I thought the headphones' noise muffling capabilities were good and callers said they could hear me well even in noisier environments except when the wind picked up around me. The headphones fold up and a simple carrying pouch (no hard case) is included along with a cable for wired listening.","3":"140","4":"0.9531","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0,0.9569804862461084,0,0,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,0,1.4726387048503082,0,0.5991182309116689,1.647323431011023,0,0.5014797613477531,0,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,0,2.165161659012004,1.7591376154027176,0.7363193524251541,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,1.875281151944789,0,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0,0.3018667074437374,2.829327262207607,0,0.4449675510844107,0.5106933836176891,0,0,0.565996446278709,0,0,0.7119845589184984,0,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0,1.4726387048503082,1.9961028493586088,0,1.469756816840031,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,0,0,0.7073318155519017,0,1.2058504980021596,0,0.11954515064978273,0,0.565996446278709,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.3018667074437374,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,1.2058504980021596,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0,0,0,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,2.037482815755616]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,4,7,8,10,12,14,15,17,19,20,21,22,24,26,27,28,30,32,33,34,36,37,41,42,44,45,48,51,53,54,56,57,59,60,61,64,66,68,70,72,75,76,77,79,82,87,88,89,90,94,95,96,98,99,101],"values":[140,0.9531,0.9569804862461084,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0.9855351440491389,1.4726387048503082,0.5991182309116689,1.647323431011023,0.5014797613477531,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0.321098069371625,2.165161659012004,1.7591376154027176,0.7363193524251541,0.5738004229273791,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,1.875281151944789,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0.3018667074437374,2.829327262207607,0.4449675510844107,0.5106933836176891,0.565996446278709,0.7119845589184984,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,1.4726387048503082,1.9961028493586088,1.469756816840031,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,0.7073318155519017,1.2058504980021596,0.11954515064978273,0.565996446278709,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,1.2058504980021596,0.7814397877056235,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,2.037482815755616]},"7":"8.164373017562214","index":41},{"0":"JBL Live Pro 2","1":"Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited.

While they may not be stellar for making calls, they do work well as a headset -- callers said they could hear me clearly, even with some outside noise around me.

JLab's Go Work headset may not be great, but it delivers better-than-expected performance for a modest price. They're also comfortable to wear with a lightweight design. You won't mistake these for premium headphones, but the build quality means that they are among the best headphones for work for around $50.Battery life is rated at up to 45 hours at moderate volume levels, and you can mute calls using the multifunction button (an LED lights up at the end of the boom mic when the call is muted). I wouldn't call the sound quality for music listening and the headset performance stellar, but it's decent, particularly for the price. For music listening, there's ample bass and clarity and a cable is included for wired use. The headphones charge via USB-C.Note that JLab also sells on  that costs $80 and does sound a little better.","3":"188","4":"0.9653","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,1.362826163040005,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,1.4726387048503082,0,0.5991182309116689,2.1964312413480305,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0,0,1.2669476034873244,1.605490346858125,0,0,0.5863792051342392,2.2089580572754626,1.539527403332833,0.5738004229273791,2.298329135661882,0,0,3.1254685865746485,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0,0,0,0,0,2.1219954466557054,0,0.4449675510844107,0.25534669180884456,0,0,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0,0.4746563726123323,0,1.7361539222088815,1.2240432714951537,1.4354707293691626,0,0,0,0.9798378778933541,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0,1.4146636311038034,2.0794415416798357,0,0,0.23909030129956546,0,0,0,1.875281151944789,0,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,1.0029595226955061,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9484938723687899,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6326847877140319,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16,17,19,20,23,24,27,28,29,30,31,34,35,36,42,44,45,48,49,51,53,54,55,59,60,61,62,64,65,68,72,74,75,79,80,82,83,87,89,91,92,94,96,97,98,99,100],"values":[188,0.9653,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.8953840470548413,1.362826163040005,0.9668430110369864,0.6250937173149297,1.4726387048503082,0.5991182309116689,2.1964312413480305,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,1.2669476034873244,1.605490346858125,0.5863792051342392,2.2089580572754626,1.539527403332833,0.5738004229273791,2.298329135661882,3.1254685865746485,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,2.1219954466557054,0.4449675510844107,0.25534669180884456,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,0.4746563726123323,1.7361539222088815,1.2240432714951537,1.4354707293691626,0.9798378778933541,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,1.4146636311038034,2.0794415416798357,0.23909030129956546,1.875281151944789,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,1.562879575411247,1.0029595226955061,0.34070654076000123,0.9484938723687899,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0.6326847877140319,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822]},"7":"8.61959125236548","index":47},{"0":"JLab Studio ANC","1":"JLab is known for its value headphones, and the JLab Studio ANC is one of the few on-ear inexpensive on-ear headphones to have active noise-canceling.

So get the Elite 4 Active if it costs less.The lightweight Elite 4 fit my ears comfortably and offered good, well-balanced sound with punchy bass and decent clarity. They support Qualcomm's AptX audio codec (for Android and other devices that support AptX) but only the SBC codec for iPhones (no AAC support). The Elite 4 is missing more premium features like ear detection sensors and has a four-microphone array for noise canceling and voice calls (voice-calling performance is good but not exceptionally good). Battery life is rated at up to seven hours at moderate volume levels and the buds have an IP55 water-resistance rating, which means they can take a sustained spray of water and are also dust-resistant. As with a lot of other new buds, you can use either bud independently in a mono mode.","3":"195","4":"0.9852","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,1.8687627514764833,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0.5250102587579472,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,0,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,0,0,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,0,2.113066952106162,1.024001424876935,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,0,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,2.1219954466557054,0,0.8899351021688214,1.0213867672353782,0,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,1.4146636311038034,1.3021154416566612,0,0.9569804862461084,0,1.9961028493586088,0,1.469756816840031,0.3114361584598881,4.562333750779637,0.41253227533125686,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,1.3583218771704109,0.11954515064978273,1.9336860220739729,0.8489946694180636,1.0045833390198333,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.6326847877140319,0,1.3021154416566612,2.2534033146308836,0.7214144149333415,0,1.122755805857644,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,11,17,18,19,20,22,23,28,29,30,32,33,34,35,36,37,39,40,41,42,44,45,47,48,50,51,52,53,55,57,59,60,61,62,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,75,79,80,81,82,87,89,91,92,93,94,96,97,98,100,101],"values":[195,0.9852,0.5991182309116689,1.8687627514764833,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0.5250102587579472,0.6814130815200025,0.6250937173149297,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,2.113066952106162,1.024001424876935,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,2.1219954466557054,0.8899351021688214,1.0213867672353782,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,1.4146636311038034,1.3021154416566612,0.9569804862461084,1.9961028493586088,1.469756816840031,0.3114361584598881,4.562333750779637,0.41253227533125686,1.2058504980021596,1.3583218771704109,0.11954515064978273,1.9336860220739729,0.8489946694180636,1.0045833390198333,1.2501874346298594,0.3018667074437374,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.34070654076000123,1.8969877447375798,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.6326847877140319,1.3021154416566612,2.2534033146308836,0.7214144149333415,1.122755805857644,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.151037869763412","index":52},{"0":"Jabra Elite 45h (Update: Currently Unavailable)","1":"Released in mid-2020, the Jabra Elite 45h was essentially billed as the best on-ear headphones for the money.

It mostly works.Note that the , which has an integrated boom microphone, is essentially the souped-up office version of these headphones.","3":"134","4":"0.9601","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0.6250937173149297,2.2089580572754626,0,0,1.0982156206740152,0,0,0,0,0.4671906878691208,0,0,0,0.963294208114875,0,0,1.1727584102684785,0.7363193524251541,0,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0,0,0.7073318155519017,0,0.4449675510844107,0,3.314770690224677,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,0,0.48991893894667704,0,1.303523928794182,0,1.2240432714951537,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,1.3583218771704109,0.23909030129956546,0,0.565996446278709,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,0,0.4340384805522204,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,1.122755805857644,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,4,8,11,12,15,20,24,27,28,30,31,32,33,34,35,37,38,39,42,44,46,48,50,51,52,53,54,55,57,59,61,63,64,65,66,67,68,70,72,75,79,80,90,92,94,96,98,99,100],"values":[134,0.9601,0.4784902431230542,0.34070654076000123,0.6250937173149297,2.2089580572754626,1.0982156206740152,0.4671906878691208,0.963294208114875,1.1727584102684785,0.7363193524251541,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0.7073318155519017,0.4449675510844107,3.314770690224677,0.2829982231393545,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0.6653676164528696,0.48991893894667704,1.303523928794182,1.2240432714951537,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,1.3583218771704109,0.23909030129956546,0.565996446278709,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0.8126923312097281,1.1476008458547582,0.4217898584760213,0.4340384805522204,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,1.122755805857644]},"7":"8.193920433405454","index":53},{"0":"Jabra Elite 7 Pro","1":"Coming in at 16% smaller than the Elite 75t, the Elite 7 Pro are Jabra's top-of-the-line earbuds in its new range and include the company's new MultiSensor Voice technology with a bone-conduction sensor, four microphones and intelligent algorithms to deliver new \"ground-breaking call quality,\" Jabra says.

The charging case has wireless charging capabilities.The earbuds' IP57 rating means they are dust-resistant and fully waterproof (they can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water).

While this is an on-ear headset, it has a nicely padded headband and earpieces and is impressively comfortable (it also helps that it's relatively lightweight, weighing 136 grams or 4.8 ounces).I was impressed with the sound and performance of the Evolve2 65 Flex. It has a retractable boom microphone and good active noise canceling along with excellent noise reduction for calls (I made calls in the noisy streets of New York and callers said I sounded clear with little background noise intrusion). Flip the boom mic up and you automatically get muted during video conference calls; flip it down and you unmute yourself.With 28mm drivers, this headset also works well for listening to music and other audio, which is what you should expect for its high price tag. However, it only supports the SBC audio codec and not the superior AAC or aptX audio codecs (that's not the end of the world, but it is worth pointing out). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, you can connect it to a variety of devices wirelessly and the included Bluetooth USB-A dongle allows for easy pairing with PCs (you can connect it to two devices at the same time). Finally, battery life is rated at up to 21 hours with noise-canceling on and 32 hours with it off. That's decent for a compact headset.","3":"255","4":"0.9618","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,1.9139609724922169,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0,1.4726387048503082,3.1254685865746485,1.1982364618233379,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0,1.5938879484831778,0,1.605490346858125,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,1.1476008458547582,0,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,0.6250937173149297,3.125759150822494,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,0,0,0,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,0,0,0.4746563726123323,1.4146636311038034,1.3021154416566612,1.2240432714951537,2.392451215615271,0,0,0,1.469756816840031,0,0,1.2375968259937706,2.4480865429903074,0.7073318155519017,2.0794415416798357,1.6078006640028795,2.037482815755616,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,1.0045833390198333,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.6037334148874748,1.318240897874875,0,0,0.8039003320014397,2.5658790055547214,1.024001424876935,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0,1.362826163040005,1.562879575411247,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.4217898584760213,0,1.7361539222088815,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,1.122755805857644,0]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[255,0.9618,0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,1.9139609724922169,0.7511344382102946,0,0.8953840470548413,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0,1.4726387048503082,3.1254685865746485,1.1982364618233379,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0,1.5938879484831778,0,1.605490346858125,0,0.7217205530040013,0,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,1.1476008458547582,0,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,0.6250937173149297,3.125759150822494,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,0,0,0,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,0,0,0.4746563726123323,1.4146636311038034,1.3021154416566612,1.2240432714951537,2.392451215615271,0,0,0,1.469756816840031,0,0,1.2375968259937706,2.4480865429903074,0.7073318155519017,2.0794415416798357,1.6078006640028795,2.037482815755616,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,1.0045833390198333,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.6037334148874748,1.318240897874875,0,0,0.8039003320014397,2.5658790055547214,1.024001424876935,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0,1.362826163040005,1.562879575411247,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0,1.1476008458547582,1.562879575411247,0.4217898584760213,0,1.7361539222088815,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,1.122755805857644,0]},"7":"8.209335112299012","index":56},{"0":"Jabra Evolve2 85 UC","1":"If you're looking for a souped-up version of Jabra's Elite 85h headphones, which came out a few years ago, the Evolve2 85 offers even better telephony options along with a Unified Communications USB dongle for PCs.

I thought they sounded good while listening to music on my phone. However, the sound quality wasn't quite up to the same level when streaming Bluetooth audio on my computer, though it was still decent.

This is an on-ear model that competes with Jabra's Evolve2 65 Flex but is a bit heavier (230 grams) and has some metal parts (the headset feels both substantial and sturdy with a premium look). It is comfortable to wear for long periods with soft ear pads filled with high-quality memory foam. Like the Jabra, this Logitech has a retractable boom microphone with a mute button on it. It also has active noise cancellation and I thought it did a good job muffling external noise and reducing background noise when I was on calls. You can also toggle on a transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world. The headset is equipped with five microphones and uses Bluetooth 5.2 with a wireless range of 50 meters, which is much better than the typical 10-meter range of Bluetooth. Battery life is rated at up to 15 hours with noise canceling on and 18 hours with it off.People were impressed by how clear I sounded on calls, even when I tested the headset in the noisy streets of New York. Sound quality has also improved, and while this doesn't sound as good as Sony or Bose headphones, the sound quality for listening to music is quite respectable. It support the SBC, AAC and AptX audio codecs (Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex only supports SBC).The white version I tried was Microsoft Teams certified and came with a USB-A/USB-C Bluetooth dongle for computer use and a slim carry pouch. In all, this is a nice upgrade over Logitech's Zone Wireless Headset and a top headset.","3":"276","4":"0.9952","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.9343813757382416,2.8709414587383253,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,2.0442392445600075,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0.7363193524251541,2.5003748692597187,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,1.8255515795334214,0,0,1.3862943611198906,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,0.7969439742415889,0,2.247686485601375,2.63648179574975,2.165161659012004,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,1.2074668297749496,0,0,1.562879575411247,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,0.4449675510844107,1.0213867672353782,0,0,1.4149911156967727,1.6253846624194561,0,0.4746563726123323,2.1219954466557054,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.469756816840031,0.9343084753796642,0,0.41253227533125686,1.8360649072427306,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,2.037482815755616,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0,1.875281151944789,0,0,0,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,2.0059190453910123,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.362826163040005,1.562879575411247,1.8969877447375798,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,0,1.0544746461900532,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[276,0.9952,0,0.9343813757382416,2.8709414587383253,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,2.0442392445600075,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0.7363193524251541,2.5003748692597187,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,1.8255515795334214,0,0,1.3862943611198906,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,0.7969439742415889,0,2.247686485601375,2.63648179574975,2.165161659012004,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,1.2074668297749496,0,0,1.562879575411247,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,0.4449675510844107,1.0213867672353782,0,0,1.4149911156967727,1.6253846624194561,0,0.4746563726123323,2.1219954466557054,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,3.0646892622993405,1.469756816840031,0.9343084753796642,0,0.41253227533125686,1.8360649072427306,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,2.037482815755616,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0,1.875281151944789,0,0,0,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,2.0059190453910123,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.362826163040005,1.562879575411247,1.8969877447375798,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,0,1.0544746461900532,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.330591154179206","index":61},{"0":"Mark Levinson No. 5909","1":"The No. 5909 are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones. Yes, they're expensive at $999 and probably a wee bit overpriced, but they're excellent. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial, but not heavy) and they're comfortable to wear over long periods thanks to their nicely padded (and replaceable) leather-covered earcups and headbands.Not only do they have good noise canceling and excellent sound, but their voice-calling performance is top-notch, making them one of the best noise-canceling headphones options on the market. Plus, they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices, such as a computer and a phone, simultaneously.The No. 5909 are high-res certified with support for Sony's LDAC and Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive codecs that allow for near-lossless streaming over Bluetooth. Apple's iPhones and iPads don't support those codecs while certain Android devices do. Using the No. 5909 headphones over Bluetooth on my iPhone 13 Pro, it sounded a tad more natural and refined than the AirPods Max (the No. 5909 had a touch more \"pure\" and accurate sound).I did notice a difference when I paired the No. 5909 to my Google Pixel 4 XL, which has support for LDAC, and using the Qobuz audio streaming service that offers high-res streaming. Overall, the sound had a little more depth and texture, and there's a touch more sparkle, definition and openness.","3":"230","4":"0.9948","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,5.372304282329048,0.34070654076000123,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.5991182309116689,2.1964312413480305,0,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0.64219613874325,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,1.7214012687821372,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,0,1.2501874346298594,1.562879575411247,0,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,0.7073318155519017,0,0,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,0,1.1866409315308308,0,2.170192402761102,0,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,1.3862943611198906,1.2058504980021596,0,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,3.1254685865746485,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,1.362826163040005,0,0,3.2507693248389122,0.7214144149333415,1.7214012687821372,0,0,1.3583218771704109,0,2.2534033146308836,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[230,0.9948,0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,5.372304282329048,0.34070654076000123,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.5991182309116689,2.1964312413480305,0,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0.64219613874325,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,1.7214012687821372,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,0,1.2501874346298594,1.562879575411247,0,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,0.7073318155519017,0,0,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,0,1.1866409315308308,0,2.170192402761102,0,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,1.3862943611198906,1.2058504980021596,0,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,3.1254685865746485,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,1.362826163040005,0,0,3.2507693248389122,0.7214144149333415,1.7214012687821372,0,0,1.3583218771704109,0,2.2534033146308836,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.602862306119095","index":62},{"0":"Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd Generation)","1":"All of Master & Dynamic's headphones are well built (they're sturdy) and have a unique retro-modern look. The higher-end MW75 has active noise canceling and sounds a little better than the freshly updated MH40, which features new drivers and a new chipset that delivers improved sound and performance. But the MH40 sounds more refined than its predecessor, with better clarity and definition, and now offers support for the AAC and AptX audio codecs, plus improved voice-calling performance. Additionally, you can plug its USB-C cable into a computer or Android smartphone for a wired digital connection for high-resolution audio. Battery life is rated at a healthy 30 hours.To be clear, this isn't a noise-canceling headphone, but you do get decent passive noise isolation from the nicely padded ear cups, which adhere magnetically and are easy to swap out should they eventually show some wear. Available in several color options, the MH40s are comfortable to wear -- they weigh 280 grams -- but may not be a good fit for those with smaller heads.","3":"172","4":"0.986","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,0.4784902431230542,0,1.5750307762738416,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.4726387048503082,1.875281151944789,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0,0,0,0.6931471805599453,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,0.7969439742415889,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,0,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,0,0,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,0,0.4449675510844107,0.7660400754265337,0,0,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,1.1727584102684785,1.1866409315308308,0.7073318155519017,1.3021154416566612,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,0,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,0,1.6501291013250274,0,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,0,0.23909030129956546,0,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,0,0,0,0,0,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,0,1.5044392840432592,1.6253846624194561,0.7814397877056235,0,1.0221196222800037,1.562879575411247,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0.5738004229273791,1.562879575411247,0,0.6791609385852054,0.8680769611044408,0,1.0821216224000123,0,0,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,11,12,13,14,15,19,20,21,22,24,28,29,30,31,34,37,38,41,42,44,45,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,57,59,60,62,64,65,66,68,70,71,77,78,79,80,83,84,85,87,88,90,92,93,95,96,98],"values":[172,0.986,0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,0.4784902431230542,1.5750307762738416,0.6814130815200025,0.6250937173149297,1.4726387048503082,1.875281151944789,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0.6931471805599453,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,0.7969439742415889,0.321098069371625,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,1.875281151944789,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,0.4449675510844107,0.7660400754265337,0.565996446278709,0.8126923312097281,1.1727584102684785,1.1866409315308308,0.7073318155519017,1.3021154416566612,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0.6653676164528696,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,1.6501291013250274,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,0.23909030129956546,0.2829982231393545,1.0045833390198333,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,1.5044392840432592,1.6253846624194561,0.7814397877056235,1.0221196222800037,1.562879575411247,0.8126923312097281,0.5738004229273791,1.562879575411247,0.6791609385852054,0.8680769611044408,1.0821216224000123]},"7":"8.055583097466002","index":63},{"0":"Master & Dynamic MW09","1":"Master & Dynamic headphones and earbuds have always featured unique, eye-catching designs that include premium materials like aluminum, sapphire glass and Kevlar.

The MW75's build quality is hard to beat and they offer top-notch sound for a wireless model (I thought they sounded better than Apple's AirPods Max headphones), plus strong voice-calling and noise-canceling performance. With their support for aptX Adaptive, they have additional appeal for Android users, who can get a touch better sound quality with the right setup.

Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, they also have support for a good range of audio codecs, including AAC (iPhones), LHDC 4.0, SBC, and LC3 (the successor to SBC). OnePlus says an upgrade to LHDC 5.0 will be available via a firmware upgrade (LHDC stands for low-latency high-definition and it's supposed to be close to on par with Sony's LDAC audio codec).I found the noise-canceling to be good but not up to the level of what you get with Apple, Sony and Bose earbuds. Voice-calling performance was also above average with decent though not fantastic noise reduction on the streets of New York. (Callers said they could hear me well despite some background noise so the microphone quality seems good.) Owners of the new OnePlus 11 smartphone can take advantage of the buds' spatial audio feature. (Other smartphones may support spatial audio with the Buds Pro 2 in the future but for now, it's exclusive to the OnePlus 11.) The buds are rated for 6 hours of battery life with noise canceling on and are IP55 splashproof. The compact charging case supports wireless charging with a little more than four extra charges in the case.","3":"247","4":"0.9261","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,1.4015720636073625,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,2.3908319227247667,1.2669476034873244,1.2843922774865,1.318240897874875,0.7217205530040013,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0,0,0.6037334148874748,2.04800284975387,0,0,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,6.2628243130386885,0,0,0.6037334148874748,2.1219954466557054,1.242254990896953,1.3349026532532322,1.5320801508530675,1.6573853451123386,0,0.8489946694180636,1.6253846624194561,0,0.4746563726123323,2.829327262207607,3.472307844417763,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0,0.9798378778933541,0.3114361584598881,0,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,0,0,0,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,1.539527403332833,0,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,0,0,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,1.6253846624194561,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,1.4762645046660745,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,1.6841337087864658,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[247,0.9261,0.5991182309116689,1.4015720636073625,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0,0,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,2.3908319227247667,1.2669476034873244,1.2843922774865,1.318240897874875,0.7217205530040013,0,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,0,0,0.6037334148874748,2.04800284975387,0,0,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,6.2628243130386885,0,0,0.6037334148874748,2.1219954466557054,1.242254990896953,1.3349026532532322,1.5320801508530675,1.6573853451123386,0,0.8489946694180636,1.6253846624194561,0,0.4746563726123323,2.829327262207607,3.472307844417763,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0,0.9798378778933541,0.3114361584598881,0,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,0,0,0,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,1.539527403332833,0,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,0,0,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,1.6253846624194561,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,1.4762645046660745,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,1.6841337087864658,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.704679215412895","index":68},{"0":"Oraimo Open Ear Headphones (Currently Unavailable)","1":"The one downside to bone-conduction headphones is that they just don't sound great for music and tend to fall short most noticeably in the bass department. Oraimo's Open Ear Headphones look like a bone-conduction model but instead have speakers built into them that fire sound into your ears. That sound is better than what you get with bone-conduction headphones (it's bigger with better bass performance). I wouldn't say they sound quite as good as decent noise-isolating earbuds, but the sound is quite respectable and has a nice open quality to it because these are after all \"open\" headphones.The Oraimo is more expensive than some similarly styled open-ear headphones you can find on Amazon. But these did seem durable and also are good for making calls, with solid background noise reduction. This style of headphones isn't for everyone (some may find them slightly uncomfortable after longer listening sessions), but they do stay on your ears securely and allow you to hear the outside world for safety reasons. Battery life is rated at 16 hours at moderate volume levels and they're splashproof.","3":"180","4":"0.984","5":{"type":1,"values":[2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,0,2.2089580572754626,1.2501874346298594,0,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,0.6931471805599453,0,0,0,2.5338952069746488,0,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,0.5738004229273791,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.5106933836176891,0,0,0.565996446278709,0,0,0.23732818630616614,1.4146636311038034,0,0.6120216357475768,0,0,0,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0,0,0.5977257532489136,0,0.8489946694180636,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0.8126923312097281,1.562879575411247,0,0,2.3443193631168704,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,0,1.0821216224000123,0,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,12,13,15,16,17,19,23,27,28,29,30,31,32,35,37,41,43,44,45,48,51,52,54,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,68,70,72,75,78,79,80,82,83,84,85,88,90,92,93,94,95,96,98,100],"values":[180,0.984,2.3964729236466757,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0.6814130815200025,2.2089580572754626,1.2501874346298594,2.745539051685038,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0.6931471805599453,2.5338952069746488,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,0.5738004229273791,2.298329135661882,0.3018667074437374,0.7814397877056235,0.9056001223312122,0.3018667074437374,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.5106933836176891,0.565996446278709,0.23732818630616614,1.4146636311038034,0.6120216357475768,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,0.5977257532489136,0.8489946694180636,1.2501874346298594,0.6037334148874748,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0.8126923312097281,1.562879575411247,2.3443193631168704,0.8126923312097281,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.0821216224000123,0.561377902928822]},"7":"7.72817846105905","index":69},{"0":"Panasonic RP-HJE120","1":"Panasonic's ErgoFit RP-HJE120 in-ear headphones, which come in multiple colors and retail for less than $10, sound remarkably good for the money.

Now we get the Voyager Focus 2 UC from Poly (the company Plantronics morphed into after it acquired Polycom), and it's improved in several ways, including better noise reduction (it's stellar), two levels of active noise canceling, increased battery life (up to 19 hours with ANC off and 16 hours with it on) and superior wireless range with Bluetooth 5.1. You can pair the Voyager Focus 2 UC with your computer with the included USB dongle or your phone (or tablet) via Bluetooth. It can also connect to a desk phone if you want to bring it to the office. Also worth noting: The boom microphone has a mute button on it, but when you flip it up it also automatically mutes the microphone. The original Voyager Focus doesn't mute when you lift the boom microphone.The Focus 2 comes in several different versions, including USB-A and USB-C models and a version that's Microsoft Teams certified. You can get the headset by itself or in a bundle that includes a charging dock. All versions include a nice protective carrying pouch.The Voyager Focus 2 UC is expensive but offers excellent performance and is quite comfortable for an on-ear headphone. It also sounds good for music listening with nicely detailed sound and ample bass. It may not be quite up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 for music, but it offers a nice music listening experience for a work-centric headset.Pros:Lightweight and comfortable to wearStellar noise reduction for callsRetractable boom microphone with mute buttonDecent noise canceling and sound qualityUSB wireless adapter included for PCsCons:Version with USB-C wireless dongle is more expensive","3":"282","4":"0.9929","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.4671906878691208,0.9569804862461084,0,0.5250102587579472,3.5815361882193653,1.362826163040005,0.9668430110369864,0,0,2.2089580572754626,3.1254685865746485,1.7973546927350068,0,0,1.0029595226955061,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.92658841622975,2.63648179574975,1.4434411060080026,1.1727584102684785,2.9452774097006165,1.0263516022218886,2.2952016917095164,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,6.14400854926161,0,1.562879575411247,2.245511611715288,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0,1.4146636311038034,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.25534669180884456,0,0,1.4149911156967727,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,0,1.3021154416566612,1.8360649072427306,0.9569804862461084,0,0,1.5323446311496702,0.9798378778933541,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0.7073318155519017,2.772588722239781,0,2.037482815755616,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,2.5003748692597187,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.08462604669337,2.813651162005039,2.052703204443777,1.024001424876935,3.125759150822494,3.0088785680865184,4.0634616560486405,1.562879575411247,0,0.34070654076000123,1.562879575411247,0,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.6871594339040852,1.3583218771704109,1.7361539222088815,0,0,0,0,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[282,0.9929,0,0.4671906878691208,0.9569804862461084,0,0.5250102587579472,3.5815361882193653,1.362826163040005,0.9668430110369864,0,0,2.2089580572754626,3.1254685865746485,1.7973546927350068,0,0,1.0029595226955061,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.92658841622975,2.63648179574975,1.4434411060080026,1.1727584102684785,2.9452774097006165,1.0263516022218886,2.2952016917095164,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,6.14400854926161,0,1.562879575411247,2.245511611715288,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0,1.4146636311038034,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.25534669180884456,0,0,1.4149911156967727,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,0,1.3021154416566612,1.8360649072427306,0.9569804862461084,0,0,1.5323446311496702,0.9798378778933541,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0.7073318155519017,2.772588722239781,0,2.037482815755616,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,2.5003748692597187,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.08462604669337,2.813651162005039,2.052703204443777,1.024001424876935,3.125759150822494,3.0088785680865184,4.0634616560486405,1.562879575411247,0,0.34070654076000123,1.562879575411247,0,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.6871594339040852,1.3583218771704109,1.7361539222088815,0,0,0,0,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.8682718590462","index":71},{"0":"Poly Voyager Free 60 Plus UC","1":"Like JBL's Tour Pro 2 earbuds, the Poly Voyager Free 60 Plus UC earbuds also have a touchscreen display embedded in their charging case. The display isn't quite as fancy as the one on the JBL case (it's mostly monochrome), but these are among the first earbuds to have a case with a mini control panel integrated into it. Additionally, the Free 60 Plus UC case also turns into a Bluetooth transceiver for inflight entertainment systems (you plug the case into the 3.5mm headphone port). I also liked how you can store the USB-A Bluetooth dongle in the charging case when you're not using it with your computer. Aside from the tricked out case, the bigl strengths of the Poly Voyager Free 60 are their comfortable fit, excellent voice-calling performance for video calls (they have three-mic array in each bud), solid noice canceling and very good sound quality. Equipped with 10mm drivers, they might not offer quite as good sound quality for music as other premium earbuds in this price range, but there's good depth and punch to the bass, decent clarity and they have a pleasant sound profile overall. They support the AAC and AptX audio codecs as well as LC3 when making video calls, Poly says. Battery life is rated at up to 5.5 hours with noise canceling on. I was able to easily switch between using the buds with my computer (with the USB dongle) and my iPhone. While they worked well for making cell-phone calls indoors and outdoors in quieter environments, callers said they could hear a good amount of background noise when I was making calls in noisier environments. Poly says it's working to improve noise reduction for cell-phone calls with a firmware update later this year. The earbuds can be updated via the Poly Lens app for Desktop, iOS or Android that also features a variety of settings you can play around with.Note that these earbuds are available in a non-UC version with a standard charging case for $230 or $100 less.","3":"336","4":"0.9978","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,1.2501874346298594,1.4726387048503082,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,1.9596757557867082,1.5938879484831778,0,0.963294208114875,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0,1.149164567830941,1.2074668297749496,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,0,0,3.5597404086752857,0.25534669180884456,0,0,1.131992892557418,1.6253846624194561,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,2.1219954466557054,3.0382693638655427,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0,2.6614704658114783,1.5323446311496702,2.939513633680062,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,2.4751936519875413,2.4480865429903074,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,2.411700996004319,0,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,1.6979893388361271,2.0091666780396666,1.875281151944789,0,0,2.113066952106162,2.63648179574975,1.7591376154027176,1.08462604669337,1.2058504980021596,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,0.34070654076000123,1.562879575411247,0.9484938723687899,1.6253846624194561,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,1.2653695754280638,4.754126570096438,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,2.8068895146441095,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[336,0.9978,0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,1.2501874346298594,1.4726387048503082,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,2.0794415416798357,1.4015720636073625,1.9596757557867082,1.5938879484831778,0,0.963294208114875,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0,1.149164567830941,1.2074668297749496,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,0,0,3.5597404086752857,0.25534669180884456,0,0,1.131992892557418,1.6253846624194561,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,2.1219954466557054,3.0382693638655427,1.2240432714951537,0.4784902431230542,0,2.6614704658114783,1.5323446311496702,2.939513633680062,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,2.4751936519875413,2.4480865429903074,1.4146636311038034,0.6931471805599453,2.411700996004319,0,0.3586354519493482,0.9668430110369864,1.6979893388361271,2.0091666780396666,1.875281151944789,0,0,2.113066952106162,2.63648179574975,1.7591376154027176,1.08462604669337,1.2058504980021596,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,0.34070654076000123,1.562879575411247,0.9484938723687899,1.6253846624194561,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,1.2653695754280638,4.754126570096438,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,2.8068895146441095,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.352987383457416","index":72},{"0":"Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One (Currently: Unavailable)","1":"The Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox is a beast of wireless headset, at least in terms of size. That said, it's not heavy and its auto-adjusting headband makes this one of the most comfortable gaming headsets you can buy; just note that its ear cups really stick out from your head. The ear pads are equipped with cooling gel-infused cushions, and the Razer logo lights up.Aside from excellent sound quality and comfort, the other signature feature is the built-in HyperSense haptic feedback technology that lets you feel the game while you're playing. One might call it a gimmick but it does add another dimension to the gaming experience. The only downside is that battery life takes a hit when you engage it. It's 6 hours with HyperSense on and 20 hours with it turned off.It's worth pointing out that this is an open-back headset, which does help open up the soundstage and give the audio a more airy quality, but the sound will leak out of the headphones, which could annoy others around you.

They charge in a case that's the same size and shape as what you currently get with all of Samsung's latest Galaxy Buds, including the Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. And they look a lot like an updated version of Samsung's discontinued Galaxy Buds Plus earbuds, which also came with a set of swappable fins that helped create a secure, comfortable fit. Like those buds, the Galaxy Buds FE are sweat-resistant with an IPX2 water-resistance rating that protects against splashes. They don't sound quite as rich as the Galaxy Buds Pro, and their voice-calling performance isn't up to the Buds Pro's level (it's decent, not great). But they do offer respectable sound quality (it's certainly as good as the Galaxy Buds 2's) and decent noise canceling. I also found them to be lightweight and comfortable to wear. While they may not measure up to more premium earbuds, including the Buds Pro, they deliver good bang for the buck. The Galaxy Buds FE are rated for up to 6 hours of battery life with noise canceling on and 8.5 hours with it off.","3":"212","4":"0.9844","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,0.9569804862461084,3.0045377528411783,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,1.875281151944789,1.1982364618233379,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0,0.48991893894667704,0,0,0,0,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,1.149164567830941,0.9056001223312122,2.04800284975387,0.6250937173149297,0,1.122755805857644,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,2.8088136098972902,0.8286926725561693,0,0.8489946694180636,0,0,0.7119845589184984,0,0.4340384805522204,0.6120216357475768,0,0,0,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,3.425797743058769,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0,0,0.3586354519493482,1.9336860220739729,1.131992892557418,0,0,0,0,1.509333537218687,0,0,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,0,0,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0,0,1.0544746461900532,1.3583218771704109,1.7361539222088815,0.7511344382102946,0,1.1476008458547582,0,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,13,14,16,17,18,19,21,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,36,37,40,41,43,44,45,46,48,51,53,54,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,68,69,70,75,78,79,80,82,83,84,89,90,91,94,95,96,97,99,101],"values":[212,0.9844,0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,0.9569804862461084,3.0045377528411783,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.34070654076000123,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,1.875281151944789,1.1982364618233379,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0.48991893894667704,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,1.7214012687821372,1.149164567830941,0.9056001223312122,2.04800284975387,0.6250937173149297,1.122755805857644,0.3018667074437374,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,2.8088136098972902,0.8286926725561693,0.8489946694180636,0.7119845589184984,0.4340384805522204,0.6120216357475768,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,3.425797743058769,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.3586354519493482,1.9336860220739729,1.131992892557418,1.509333537218687,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,1.0544746461900532,1.3583218771704109,1.7361539222088815,0.7511344382102946,1.1476008458547582,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.329148925724235","index":74},{"0":"Samsung Galaxy Buds Live","1":"Say what you will about the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live's bean-shaped design, but it is innovative. Like the standard AirPods 3, they have an open design -- you don't jam an ear tip into your ear -- and they're quite comfortable, fitting my ears more securely than the AirPods. That said, they won't fit everybody's ears equally well. These wireless buds are discreet and sit flush with your ear without a little white pipe extending out from them.They deliver good sound and work well as a headset for making calls, with good background noise reduction so callers can hear you clearly even when you're in noisier environments. While they feature active noise canceling, it's mild compared with the noise canceling in earbuds that have a noise-isolating design. In other words, buy them for their design and sound, not their noise-canceling features.","3":"141","4":"0.9872","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0,1.5750307762738416,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,0,0,1.2843922774865,0,0,1.1727584102684785,0,1.0263516022218886,0,0,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.4449675510844107,1.0213867672353782,0,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0,0.6120216357475768,0,0.7363193524251541,0,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,0,0.40195016600071987,0,0.11954515064978273,1.9336860220739729,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,0,0,0,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,11,18,19,20,21,24,27,29,32,33,35,37,40,41,44,45,47,48,50,54,56,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,66,68,69,70,71,72,75,77,78,79,82,83,85,87,91,92,93,94,96,100,101],"values":[141,0.9872,0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,1.5750307762738416,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0.6250937173149297,0.9484938723687899,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.48991893894667704,1.2843922774865,1.1727584102684785,1.0263516022218886,0.3018667074437374,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.3018667074437374,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0.4449675510844107,1.0213867672353782,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0.5863792051342392,0.6120216357475768,0.7363193524251541,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,0.40195016600071987,0.11954515064978273,1.9336860220739729,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.8039003320014397,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,0.7814397877056235,0.34070654076000123,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.8680769611044408,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.33189208915063","index":75},{"0":"Sennheiser 660S2","1":"While the Sennheiser 660S2 may seem expensive, they're one of the more affordable pairs of true audiophile headphones, sharing the same design as their predecessor, the 660S. The changes are all on the inside, with improved airflow and upgraded drivers that include a new ultralight aluminum voice coil. This leads to better sound, with the bass adding more depth and definition, while the treble gains a bit more clarity and sizzle (the very natural-sounding mids remain pretty much unchanged as far as I can tell). The soundstage also seems more spacious and airy -- yes, these are open-back headphones so they do leak sound.Note that the 660S2 require some extra power to drive (they're now 300-ohm headphones), so you'll want to pair them with a dedicated headphone amplifier. I did manage to use them with an iPhone, by plugging them into an AudioQuest Dragonfly USB DAC/Amp (there's also a version for Android smartphones). They sounded great listening to high-resolution tracks from Qobuz, the music streaming service.Audiophile headphones usually have a very neutral sound profile, but the 660S2 don't suffer from being overly so. They mix in just enough excitement while also managing to sound really clean and smooth. They're also comfortable, though some people with larger heads have complained that they feel a bit too tight on their heads.

For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors.The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, as well as the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that \"assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste.\" Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers \"best-in-class\" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.","3":"229","4":"0.9879","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.362826163040005,0,1.9710702880982778,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0,1.0982156206740152,0,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,0,0.64219613874325,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0,0.7363193524251541,0,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,2.113066952106162,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,3.1314121565193442,0,1.2501874346298594,1.8112002446624245,4.243990893311411,0,0,0.7660400754265337,0,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6653676164528696,0,1.469756816840031,0,0.651761964397091,3.300258202650055,0,0.7073318155519017,2.772588722239781,1.2058504980021596,1.3583218771704109,0.8368160545484791,0,0,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,3.5103583294342715,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0,1.703532703800006,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[229,0.9879,0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,0.5250102587579472,0.8953840470548413,1.362826163040005,0,1.9710702880982778,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0.6250937173149297,0,1.0982156206740152,0,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,0,0.64219613874325,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0,0.7363193524251541,0,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,2.113066952106162,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,3.1314121565193442,0,1.2501874346298594,1.8112002446624245,4.243990893311411,0,0,0.7660400754265337,0,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6653676164528696,0,1.469756816840031,0,0.651761964397091,3.300258202650055,0,0.7073318155519017,2.772588722239781,1.2058504980021596,1.3583218771704109,0.8368160545484791,0,0,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,3.5103583294342715,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0,1.703532703800006,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.19209257541588","index":77},{"0":"Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3","1":"Featuring excellent sound, improved noise canceling and voice-calling, and a smaller, more refined design, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 was among the best new true-wireless earbuds of 2022.

Battery life is rated at up to 9 hours at moderate volume levels with an additional two charges in the charging case (there's no wireless charging).Featuring clean and well-balanced sound with punchy bass, they sound very similar to the CX True Wireless and CX Plus True Wireless.","3":"135","4":"0.9527","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0,1.8969877447375798,0.6931471805599453,0.4671906878691208,0,0.7969439742415889,0,0.64219613874325,0,0,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0,0,0,1.562879575411247,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0,0,0.8899351021688214,0.7660400754265337,0.8286926725561693,0,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0,0,0.48991893894667704,0.3114361584598881,1.303523928794182,0.8250645506625137,0,0,0,0,2.037482815755616,0.3586354519493482,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.539527403332833,0,1.562879575411247,2.5073988067387654,0,0,0,0,0,0.9484938723687899,4.0634616560486405,1.0821216224000123,0,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,13,15,16,18,19,20,22,24,29,30,35,37,40,41,44,45,46,48,50,51,52,53,55,59,60,61,62,67,68,72,75,77,79,80,82,83,89,90,91,93,94,96,99],"values":[135,0.9527,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.2501874346298594,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,1.8969877447375798,0.6931471805599453,0.4671906878691208,0.7969439742415889,0.64219613874325,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,1.562879575411247,0.6037334148874748,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0.8899351021688214,0.7660400754265337,0.8286926725561693,0.2829982231393545,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.8680769611044408,0.4784902431230542,0.48991893894667704,0.3114361584598881,1.303523928794182,0.8250645506625137,2.037482815755616,0.3586354519493482,0.6250937173149297,0.6037334148874748,0.5863792051342392,0.8039003320014397,1.539527403332833,1.562879575411247,2.5073988067387654,0.9484938723687899,4.0634616560486405,1.0821216224000123,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.8680769611044408,0.5738004229273791]},"7":"8.563208207505568","index":79},{"0":"Shokz OpenComm 2 UC","1":"A few years ago Shokz turned its OpenRun (formerly Aeropex) bone-conduction headphones into a more communications-friendly headset with an integrated boom microphone called the  ($249), . The second-generation OpenComm 2 UC costs more than the original, but it has an upgraded Bluetooth 5.1 chipset that improves performance a bit and now allows for the firmware upgrades that are required for Zoom certification. Additionally, the microphone has moved from the left ear to the right and a convenient mute button has been added to the boom microphone -- an important addition. Since these leave your ears open -- the sound is conducted through your cheekbone -- they aren't for people who want to seal their ears out from outside noise. Rather, the idea is that you can hear everything around you without having anything covering your ears or jammed inside them. The headset is quite comfortable to wear. Some folks find that liberating and these do feature excellent noise reduction for calls, as callers told me they heard very little background noise even when I was out on the noisy streets of New York. While the Shokz are arguably the best-sounding bone-conduction headphones, they aren't great-sounding for music because they're lacking in the bass department. But they're great for speech, so they work very well as a headset for making calls and listening to podcasts or audiobooks. These also have multipoint-Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with your phone and PC and easily switch to your phone if a call comes in while you're on your computer. And they come with either a USB-A or USB-C wireless dongle (you choose) that you plug into your computer for quick and reliable wireless connectivity.  As long as you don't mind the boom microphone, you can use the OpenComm 2 for sporting activities as well and are favorites for runners who want to keep their ears open to hear the outside world for safety reasons. They're also water-resistant. The only downside is they require a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C. Battery life is rated at 16 hours of talk time and 8 hours of listening.","3":"348","4":"0.9887","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,1.703532703800006,0,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,1.7973546927350068,1.0982156206740152,2.738327369300132,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,1.605490346858125,1.318240897874875,2.165161659012004,0.5863792051342392,2.9452774097006165,1.0263516022218886,1.7214012687821372,2.298329135661882,0.6037334148874748,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,1.3349026532532322,0.7660400754265337,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0,0.4746563726123323,2.1219954466557054,1.3021154416566612,2.4480865429903074,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,2.2985169467245052,2.939513633680062,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,2.1219954466557054,2.0794415416798357,1.2058504980021596,1.3583218771704109,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9056001223312122,3.9547226936246247,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,2.0097508300035996,1.0263516022218886,0,0.7814397877056235,1.5044392840432592,1.6253846624194561,3.125759150822494,1.490091154801534,1.362826163040005,3.125759150822494,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,1.7214012687821372,0,1.2653695754280638,0.6791609385852054,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[348,0.9887,0,0.4671906878691208,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,1.703532703800006,0,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,1.7973546927350068,1.0982156206740152,2.738327369300132,0.5014797613477531,0,0.6931471805599453,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,1.605490346858125,1.318240897874875,2.165161659012004,0.5863792051342392,2.9452774097006165,1.0263516022218886,1.7214012687821372,2.298329135661882,0.6037334148874748,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,1.2074668297749496,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,1.3349026532532322,0.7660400754265337,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0,0.4746563726123323,2.1219954466557054,1.3021154416566612,2.4480865429903074,0.4784902431230542,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,2.2985169467245052,2.939513633680062,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,2.1219954466557054,2.0794415416798357,1.2058504980021596,1.3583218771704109,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9056001223312122,3.9547226936246247,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,2.0097508300035996,1.0263516022218886,0,0.7814397877056235,1.5044392840432592,1.6253846624194561,3.125759150822494,1.490091154801534,1.362826163040005,3.125759150822494,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,1.7214012687821372,0,1.2653695754280638,0.6791609385852054,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"7":"8.320778553280531","index":80},{"0":"Shokz OpenFit","1":"Shokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones.

They have an open design that fire sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology.I was impressed by how lightweight (8.3 grams) and comfortable they are -- they have one of the best ear-hook designs I've tried (Shokz calls it a Dolphin Arc ear hook).

The earbuds also sound quite good for open earbuds, though not quite as good as Cleer's Arc 2 Open Ear Sport earbuds ($170) that also have an ear-hook design.","3":"169","4":"0.9785","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0,0,1.5022688764205891,2.1000410350317886,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0,0,1.0982156206740152,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,1.3862943611198906,0,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0,0.963294208114875,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0,0,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0.7073318155519017,0,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0,0,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0,0.8250645506625137,0,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,0,0.3586354519493482,0,0.565996446278709,0,0,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,2.052703204443777,0,0,0,0,3.9071989385281176,1.490091154801534,0.6814130815200025,3.125759150822494,0.9484938723687899,0,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,0,0.7214144149333415,0,2.245511611715288,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,8,11,12,15,16,17,19,21,22,24,25,26,27,28,32,35,36,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,50,51,52,54,55,58,59,60,62,64,65,66,68,70,73,75,79,80,85,86,87,88,89,91,92,93,94,95,96,98,100,101],"values":[169,0.9785,1.1982364618233379,1.5022688764205891,2.1000410350317886,0.34070654076000123,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,1.0982156206740152,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,1.3862943611198906,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0.963294208114875,1.318240897874875,1.4434411060080026,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.6037334148874748,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0.7073318155519017,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,1.5323446311496702,0.48991893894667704,0.6228723169197762,0.8250645506625137,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,0.3586354519493482,0.565996446278709,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.2058504980021596,2.052703204443777,3.9071989385281176,1.490091154801534,0.6814130815200025,3.125759150822494,0.9484938723687899,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0.4340384805522204,0.7214144149333415,2.245511611715288,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"7.884513633167473","index":81},{"0":"Shokz OpenMove","1":"Shokz' entry-level OpenMove bone-conduction headphone lists for $80, though we've occasionally seen it drop below $70.

That makes the OpenRun Pro the best bone-conduction headphones you can get right now, although they still can't match the sound quality of traditional headphones.Bone conduction wireless headphones don't go on your ears -- they actually deliver sound to your ear through your cheekbones. The big benefit of this technology as a safety feature for running is that, thanks to its open design, you can hear what's going on around you -- traffic noise in particular -- while listening to music or having a phone conversation (yes, they perform well for voice calls). Plus, some race coordinators don't allow runners to wear anything in their ears, which is where headphones like this come in handy.Like the Aeropex, the OpenRun Pro have a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame and are rated for up to 10 hours of music playback and you can get 1.5 hours of battery life from a 5-minute charge (they have a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C, which is unfortunate). I found them comfortable to wear but you may occasionally have to adjust them on your head to relieve potential pressure points. While they do offer a bit fuller sound with more bass -- it's an incremental improvement, not a huge leap forward -- like other bone-conduction headphones these are strongest in the midrange where voices live so they're very good for podcasts, talk radio, newscasts and audiobooks. A hard carrying case is included. Note that Shokz makes other, more affordable bone-conduction headphones, including the OpenRun, if you don't want to drop $180 on its current flagship model.","3":"291","4":"0.9806","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.5750307762738416,0,0.6814130815200025,0,1.9710702880982778,1.2501874346298594,0.7363193524251541,1.2501874346298594,1.7973546927350068,3.294646862022046,1.8255515795334214,1.0029595226955061,0.9484938723687899,0,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0,0,0,2.886882212016005,1.1727584102684785,2.2089580572754626,0.5131758011109443,2.2952016917095164,2.298329135661882,1.509333537218687,0,0,0,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0,0,1.3349026532532322,0.5106933836176891,0,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0.8126923312097281,1.1727584102684785,0.4746563726123323,0,2.170192402761102,0.6120216357475768,1.9139609724922169,0.7363193524251541,0,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,1.5571807922994405,0,0.8250645506625137,1.2240432714951537,0,2.0794415416798357,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,0,0.565996446278709,0,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,2.0059190453910123,0.8126923312097281,3.9071989385281176,2.980182309603068,0.6814130815200025,4.688638726233741,0,0,1.442828829866683,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0.8680769611044408,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,2.245511611715288,0]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[291,0.9806,1.1982364618233379,0.9343813757382416,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.5750307762738416,0,0.6814130815200025,0,1.9710702880982778,1.2501874346298594,0.7363193524251541,1.2501874346298594,1.7973546927350068,3.294646862022046,1.8255515795334214,1.0029595226955061,0.9484938723687899,0,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,1.5938879484831778,0,0,0,2.886882212016005,1.1727584102684785,2.2089580572754626,0.5131758011109443,2.2952016917095164,2.298329135661882,1.509333537218687,0,0,0,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,1.0438040521731147,0,1.2501874346298594,1.509333537218687,0,0,1.3349026532532322,0.5106933836176891,0,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0.8126923312097281,1.1727584102684785,0.4746563726123323,0,2.170192402761102,0.6120216357475768,1.9139609724922169,0.7363193524251541,0,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,1.5571807922994405,0,0.8250645506625137,1.2240432714951537,0,2.0794415416798357,1.2058504980021596,0.6791609385852054,0.4781806025991309,0,0.565996446278709,0,1.875281151944789,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,2.0059190453910123,0.8126923312097281,3.9071989385281176,2.980182309603068,0.6814130815200025,4.688638726233741,0,0,1.442828829866683,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0.8680769611044408,0,0.7214144149333415,1.1476008458547582,2.245511611715288,0]},"7":"8.005219711405317","index":83},{"0":"Shure Aonic 215 II","1":"I liked Shure's original Aonic 215 true-wireless earbuds, but they were buggy and Shure pulled them off the market.

Even though it's technically bigger than the Powerbeats Pro's case, it doesn't feel bigger, perhaps because it's slightly thinner.What's interesting about them is that the Bluetooth module is detachable. (I liked the physical control button they have instead of touch controls.)  As the name implies, the Aonic 215 True Wireless Noise-Isolating Earphones incorporate Shure's SE215 buds, the $99 model in its line of earbuds that have detachable cables. The modules, which can be bought separately for $189, are designed to drive any Shure earbuds that have a detachable cable, including the $899 SE846.Headset performance has improved (they're now stereo rather than mono for calls) and they now have an IPX4 splash-proof water-resistance rating. They have clean, well-balanced sound with nicely defined bass -- but they just don't have a ton of bass.","3":"220","4":"0.9876","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,2.1000410350317886,1.7907680941096826,0.34070654076000123,0,1.9710702880982778,0.6250937173149297,0,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,0,0,1.0029595226955061,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,1.0263516022218886,2.2952016917095164,0,0.3018667074437374,2.04800284975387,0,1.562879575411247,2.245511611715288,0.3018667074437374,0,1.9710702880982778,0,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0,1.6573853451123386,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0,1.3021154416566612,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,1.4726387048503082,0,1.5323446311496702,0,0.6228723169197762,1.9552858931912729,0,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0,0.40195016600071987,0,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.1716374236829996,0,0,0.5863792051342392,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,2.438076993629184,0.7814397877056235,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,3.2507693248389122,1.8035360373333535,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0,1.3583218771704109,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,1.6841337087864658,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[220,0.9876,1.1982364618233379,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,2.1000410350317886,1.7907680941096826,0.34070654076000123,0,1.9710702880982778,0.6250937173149297,0,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,0,0,1.0029595226955061,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,1.0263516022218886,2.2952016917095164,0,0.3018667074437374,2.04800284975387,0,1.562879575411247,2.245511611715288,0.3018667074437374,0,1.9710702880982778,0,0.3018667074437374,0,1.242254990896953,0.4449675510844107,0,1.6573853451123386,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0,1.3021154416566612,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,1.4726387048503082,0,1.5323446311496702,0,0.6228723169197762,1.9552858931912729,0,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0,0.40195016600071987,0,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.1716374236829996,0,0,0.5863792051342392,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,2.438076993629184,0.7814397877056235,0,0.34070654076000123,0.7814397877056235,0,3.2507693248389122,1.8035360373333535,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0,1.3583218771704109,0.8680769611044408,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,1.6841337087864658,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.308561259010704","index":84},{"0":"Shure Aonic 50 Gen 2","1":"A lot of us liked Shure's original Aonic 50 headphones, but they had pretty middling noise cancellation. Well, the second-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours and added a quick-charge feature. It also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 one of the best new noise-canceling headphones. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They have excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure calls them \"studio headphones\" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference).Equipped with three microphones in each ear cup, I found the call quality to be good with decent noise reduction, and there's an adjustable sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice. I wouldn't say they're exceptionally good for calls in noisier environments.The headphones do have some extra features worth noting. They offer both LDAC and aptX support for Android and other devices that support those audio codecs. You can connect the headphones to a computer or smartphone with a USB-C cable for hi-res audio transmission or use the included analog cable if your device has a 3.5mm headphone port.

Skullcandy hopes its new voice-driven platform, Skull-iQ Smart Feature Technology, will do just that. Similar to the Apple AirPods' \"Hey Siri\" feature, Skullcandy's version allows you to say \"Hey, Skullcandy\" to issue hands-free voice commands without touching a button. Skull-iQ debuts on the sports-oriented Push Active and the $80 Grind Fuel, which will be firmware updatable via the Skullcandy App.With their ear-hook design, they're essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro, and they fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro. I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but this is one of the better ones. The Push Active True earbuds are equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, are IP55 splashproof, have built-in Tile Finding Technology and are rated for up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels.","3":"167","4":"0.9396","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,1.0500205175158943,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,0,0.9343813757382416,1.469756816840031,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,0,1.4434411060080026,0,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0.9056001223312122,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0,1.122755805857644,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0,0,0,0.7073318155519017,0,0,1.0213867672353782,1.6573853451123386,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0,0,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0,0.6653676164528696,0,0,0,1.303523928794182,0.41253227533125686,0,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0.9668430110369864,0,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,2.438076993629184,0.7814397877056235,4.4702734644046025,0.6814130815200025,1.562879575411247,0,1.6253846624194561,1.0821216224000123,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,1.3021154416566612,0,0,0.5738004229273791,1.122755805857644,0]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[167,0.9396,0.5991182309116689,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,1.5022688764205891,1.0500205175158943,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,0,0.9343813757382416,1.469756816840031,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,0,1.4434411060080026,0,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0.9056001223312122,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0,1.122755805857644,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0,0,0,0.7073318155519017,0,0,1.0213867672353782,1.6573853451123386,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0,0,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0,0.6653676164528696,0,0,0,1.303523928794182,0.41253227533125686,0,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0.9668430110369864,0,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.5014797613477531,2.438076993629184,0.7814397877056235,4.4702734644046025,0.6814130815200025,1.562879575411247,0,1.6253846624194561,1.0821216224000123,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,1.3021154416566612,0,0,0.5738004229273791,1.122755805857644,0]},"7":"8.57926450799048","index":87},{"0":"Sony C500","1":"While the C500's design sensibility has more in common with the high-end  than their predecessor, the WF-XB700 Extra Bass, the C500 is not a noise-canceling model and is pretty basic as far as earbuds go, with no ear-detection sensors or transparency mode.

They're quite good, but if you can't afford them (they list for $150), the company's new budget on-ear CH-520 headphones are an intriguing option for only around $40.They lack noise canceling and are pretty no-frills, but they feature good sound for their price, are lightweight and pretty comfortable for on-ear headphones, and also have excellent battery life (they're rated for up to 50 hours at moderate volume levels). Additionally, they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with two devices simultaneously, such as a smartphone and computer, and switch audio. Voice-calling performance is decent, although not up to the level of what you get with the CH-720N. Note that there's no wired option -- this is a wireless Bluetooth-only headphone. The CH-520 offers an overall balanced sound with decent clarity. The bass has some punch to it but doesn't pack a wallop, and you're not going to get quite as wide a soundstage as you get from Sony's more expensive over-ear headphones.

I can't say these have the greatest sound -- the bass is underwhelming -- but they fit my head securely and comfortably. They're designed for folks who don't like to have earbuds jammed into their ears, and runners who want to hear the outside world for safety reasons. As their name implies, these oversized IPX4 splash-proof buds \"float\" above your ears and fire sound in their direction. They're lightweight, weighing 33 grams, and deliver up to 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels. They have a decent microphone for voice calls and the physical controls are easy to access on the left ear hook, which sits behind your ear. I wouldn't use these for critical listening, but they are well-designed for runners (a carrying pouch is included). I'd like to see them cost a little less, but hopefully, we'll see some discounts in the future.","3":"170","4":"0.9187","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,1.9139609724922169,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.64219613874325,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0.9056001223312122,1.024001424876935,0,1.562879575411247,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.4449675510844107,0.7660400754265337,0,0,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0,0,0.6120216357475768,0.9569804862461084,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,0,0,0,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,0,1.4146636311038034,1.3862943611198906,0.40195016600071987,0,0.7172709038986964,0,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,0,1.149164567830941,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,0,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0,1.562879575411247,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,2.2952016917095164,1.562879575411247,0,0.6791609385852054,0.8680769611044408,0,0.36070720746667073,0,1.122755805857644,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,11,14,15,16,17,24,27,29,30,32,33,35,36,37,38,39,41,44,45,48,49,50,51,54,55,56,57,61,62,64,65,66,68,70,71,73,75,79,80,82,83,85,87,90,91,92,93,95,96,98,100],"values":[170,0.9187,0.5991182309116689,1.9139609724922169,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0.6250937173149297,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.64219613874325,0.5863792051342392,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0.9056001223312122,1.024001424876935,1.562879575411247,0.561377902928822,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0.9855351440491389,0.6037334148874748,0.4449675510844107,0.7660400754265337,0.565996446278709,2.438076993629184,1.1727584102684785,0.23732818630616614,0.6120216357475768,0.9569804862461084,2.2089580572754626,0.6653676164528696,0.651761964397091,0.8250645506625137,1.4146636311038034,1.3862943611198906,0.40195016600071987,0.7172709038986964,0.565996446278709,1.0045833390198333,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,0.8039003320014397,0.5131758011109443,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,1.562879575411247,0.6814130815200025,0.8126923312097281,0.7214144149333415,2.2952016917095164,1.562879575411247,0.6791609385852054,0.8680769611044408,0.36070720746667073,1.122755805857644]},"7":"7.909262601141649","index":90},{"0":"Sony LinkBuds","1":"The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods.

That makes them a good choice for folks who want to hear what's going around them for safety reasons or just don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. They also have a few distinguishing extra features, including Speak to Chat and Wide Area Tap. Instead of tapping on a bud, you can tap on your face, just in front of your ear, to control playback.They're IPX4 splash-proof and thanks to their fins -- Sony calls them Arc Supporters -- they lock in your ears securely and work well for running and other sporting activities.","3":"162","4":"0.9107","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0,0,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,0,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,0,0,0,0.9484938723687899,0,0,0.9798378778933541,0,0,0.64219613874325,0,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.6250937173149297,0,1.6841337087864658,0,1.0438040521731147,0,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0.8899351021688214,0,0,0,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0,0,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7363193524251541,0,0.7661723155748351,1.9596757557867082,0.9343084753796642,0,0.41253227533125686,0,0,0.6931471805599453,0,0.6791609385852054,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0,2.3443193631168704,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,0,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,0.21089492923801065,0,0.8680769611044408,1.5022688764205891,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,1.6841337087864658,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,5,6,9,10,13,14,18,21,24,27,28,29,30,32,34,36,38,40,41,44,48,49,50,51,55,56,58,59,60,62,65,67,68,69,70,72,73,75,76,77,78,79,80,82,85,87,91,92,94,96,97,98,99,100],"values":[162,0.9107,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0.9668430110369864,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,1.1982364618233379,0.9484938723687899,0.9798378778933541,0.64219613874325,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,0.5738004229273791,0.6037334148874748,0.6250937173149297,1.6841337087864658,1.0438040521731147,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0.8899351021688214,0.2829982231393545,1.6253846624194561,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,1.4354707293691626,0.7363193524251541,0.7661723155748351,1.9596757557867082,0.9343084753796642,0.41253227533125686,0.6931471805599453,0.6791609385852054,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,1.4149911156967727,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.5131758011109443,0.7814397877056235,2.3443193631168704,0.34070654076000123,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0.21089492923801065,0.8680769611044408,1.5022688764205891,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,1.6841337087864658]},"7":"8.46620401799859","index":91},{"0":"Sony MDR-7506","1":"Introduced way back in 1991, the Sony MDR-7506 has long been a favorite headphone of recording engineers and other sound professionals (yes, these are wired headphones). The origins of its design date even further back, since the MDR-7506 headphones are, in fact, a refresh of the Sony MDR-V6 that rolled out in 1985. Both models were designed for the pro sound market, but remain hugely popular with consumers.While the two models have the same design and are very comfortable, they don't sound identical. Both offer very well-balanced sound and excellent clarity for their modest prices -- and both are great overall values.

It's an Extra Bass model, so it does have a preponderance of bass. I liked the previous version, the XB900N, and it was a decent deal when it went on sale for around $150. This updated version looks the same but offers improved noise canceling and multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair it with your phone and computer simultaneously. It also supports Sony's LDAC audio codec.While improved, the noise canceling isn't up to the level of the WH-1000XM4 or the WH-1000XM5. The WH-XB910N doesn't have some of those models' extra features, such as Speak to Chat, wearing detection sensors and Sony's Precise Voice Pickup technology. It does have a Quick Attention Mode that allows you to put your hand over the ear cup to go from noise canceling to an ambient-aware transparency mode. Also, this headphone now comes with a hard case like the WH-1000XM4. Battery life is rated at up to 30 hours at moderate volume levels -- that's the same as what you get from the WH-1000XM5.Amazon had the blue version on sale for $138 during a recent one-day flash sale. These are a nice bargain at that price, so look to pick these up when they go on sale again if they pique your interest.","3":"220","4":"0.9811","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,1.4015720636073625,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0,0,0,0,0,2.5003748692597187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.4671906878691208,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0,1.318240897874875,0,0.5863792051342392,3.6815967621257704,1.0263516022218886,0,1.149164567830941,1.509333537218687,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,2.0876081043462293,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,0.8899351021688214,0,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,1.6253846624194561,0.5863792051342392,0,0,1.7361539222088815,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,0,1.303523928794182,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0,0,2.037482815755616,0,0,0.565996446278709,0,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,0,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,3.0382693638655427,1.5022688764205891,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,13,20,21,22,23,25,27,28,29,31,32,34,35,37,38,41,42,43,44,46,47,48,49,50,53,55,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,67,70,72,73,74,75,77,78,79,82,84,85,88,89,90,91,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,101],"values":[220,0.9811,0.5991182309116689,1.4015720636073625,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,2.5003748692597187,0.4671906878691208,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,3.6815967621257704,1.0263516022218886,1.149164567830941,1.509333537218687,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.3018667074437374,2.0876081043462293,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,2.484509981793906,0.8899351021688214,1.6573853451123386,0.9668430110369864,0.8489946694180636,1.6253846624194561,0.5863792051342392,1.7361539222088815,0.4784902431230542,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.9798378778933541,1.303523928794182,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,2.037482815755616,0.565996446278709,0.6250937173149297,2.298329135661882,1.1716374236829996,0.3018667074437374,1.1727584102684785,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.7814397877056235,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,0.36070720746667073,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,3.0382693638655427,1.5022688764205891,0.36070720746667073,0.5738004229273791,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.473368855481493","index":98},{"0":"SoundPEATS Air3 Deluxe HS","1":"What makes these SoundPEATS Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound.

There's no active noise-canceling and the headphones are pretty no frills, but they do feature decent sound quality with ample bass for their low price and you can pair them to two devices simultaneously (multipoint Bluetooth). I'm slightly more partial to the Sony CH-520, which are slightly more comfortable and sound slightly better (they have a tad more clarity). That said, the H30i have a folding design, and while they don't come with a carrying pouch, they do include a headphone cord for wired listening (the Sonys are wireless only).Battery life is impressive -- the H30i are rated for up to 70 hours of listening at moderate volume levels.

They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory, it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered a more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good-performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.","3":"313","4":"0.9979","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,2.3359534393456043,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0,1.469756816840031,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.2843922774865,3.9547226936246247,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,6.250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,2.245511611715288,0.9056001223312122,2.0876081043462293,0,1.2501874346298594,2.113066952106162,2.829327262207607,0,0.8899351021688214,2.0427735344707565,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,3.9922056987172176,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,0.5977257532489136,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.2501874346298594,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.509333537218687,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,2.3443193631168704,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,2.84548161710637,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0,1.5022688764205891,1.8035360373333535,0.5738004229273791,0,0]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[313,0.9979,0,2.3359534393456043,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,1.0221196222800037,0.9668430110369864,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0.9127757897667107,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,1.3862943611198906,0,1.469756816840031,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,1.2843922774865,3.9547226936246247,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,1.149164567830941,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,6.250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,2.245511611715288,0.9056001223312122,2.0876081043462293,0,1.2501874346298594,2.113066952106162,2.829327262207607,0,0.8899351021688214,2.0427735344707565,0.8286926725561693,1.9336860220739729,0.8489946694180636,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.23732818630616614,0.7073318155519017,0.4340384805522204,1.2240432714951537,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,3.9922056987172176,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0,0.6120216357475768,2.1219954466557054,0,2.0097508300035996,1.3583218771704109,0.5977257532489136,0,0.2829982231393545,0,1.2501874346298594,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.509333537218687,2.63648179574975,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,0,2.3443193631168704,1.0029595226955061,1.6253846624194561,1.562879575411247,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,2.84548161710637,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0,1.5022688764205891,1.8035360373333535,0.5738004229273791,0,0]},"7":"8.235700664646275","index":102},{"0":"Soundcore by Anker Life P2 Mini","1":"The Soundcore by Anker Life P2 Mini earbuds have been out for some time but remain a good budget option. Available in several color options (navy is shown here), they're compact and lightweight and offer decent sound with three EQ modes to choose from. While these don't have active noise canceling, their battery life is very good at up to 8 hours at moderate volume levels. The P2 Minis are IPX5 splash-proof and perform well but not exceptionally well as a headset for making calls. Don't forget to activate the 10% off coupon available.I also like Anker's  buds, which retail for around $45 and do have active noise canceling.

They're a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space One sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45.Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users.I found them comfortable to wear, but they do look a bit bulky compared to more premium models.","3":"208","4":"0.9945","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0,1.0982156206740152,0,1.5044392840432592,0,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,0,1.5938879484831778,0,0.321098069371625,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0,0,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0.7073318155519017,0,1.7798702043376429,0,1.6573853451123386,1.9336860220739729,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,0,1.4354707293691626,0,1.9961028493586088,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.2457446338395524,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,0,2.0097508300035996,0,0.4781806025991309,0,1.4149911156967727,0,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.2074668297749496,0,2.345516820536957,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0,0.6814130815200025,0,0,4.0634616560486405,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.5022688764205891,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,8,9,10,11,15,17,19,20,22,24,25,26,27,30,32,34,35,37,40,41,42,44,46,47,49,51,52,53,55,57,58,59,60,62,63,64,66,68,70,72,73,74,75,77,80,82,84,85,87,90,91,92,94,95,96,97,98,99,100],"values":[208,0.9945,0.5991182309116689,2.2534033146308836,0.5250102587579472,0.6814130815200025,1.9336860220739729,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,1.0982156206740152,1.5044392840432592,1.3862943611198906,0.4671906878691208,1.5938879484831778,0.321098069371625,2.63648179574975,0.7217205530040013,1.1727584102684785,0.5738004229273791,0.6037334148874748,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0.3018667074437374,0.6250937173149297,1.2074668297749496,0.7073318155519017,1.7798702043376429,1.6573853451123386,1.9336860220739729,0.8126923312097281,0.7119845589184984,1.4146636311038034,0.8680769611044408,1.4354707293691626,1.9961028493586088,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.2457446338395524,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,2.0097508300035996,0.4781806025991309,1.4149911156967727,0.6250937173149297,1.149164567830941,1.1716374236829996,1.2074668297749496,2.345516820536957,0.5131758011109443,0.7814397877056235,0.8126923312097281,0.7814397877056235,0.6814130815200025,4.0634616560486405,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.4217898584760213,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.5022688764205891,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822]},"7":"7.917184183732454","index":104},{"0":"Soundcore by Anker Space Q45","1":"If you can't afford Sony's WH-1000XM5 or Bose QC45, the Soundcore by Anker Space Q45 (yes, there's a bit of copying going on here) is a good alternative for $150, and we should see occasional discounts on it. While it may not fit some smaller heads, it's comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups and a dual-hinge folding design. Sound quality is very good and the headphones offer better noise canceling than the step-down Q35, as well as multipoint Bluetooth pairing (these are equipped with Bluetooth 5.3) and support for the LDAC audio codec for streaming high-resolution music tracks over Bluetooth, if you have a device that supports LDAC. Many Android phones do, although Samsung's Galaxy phones don't. Battery life is very good at up to 50 hours with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels and the headphones come with a hard carrying case for travel.

Battery life is rated at 5 hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof.Apply the code DCCNETSP at checkout to get an additional 13% off, bringing the price down to $34 -- a very good deal if you're looking for open-style earbuds.","3":"119","4":"0.9744","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0,0,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0,0.9855351440491389,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6931471805599453,0,0.9798378778933541,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,0.3018667074437374,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0.6250937173149297,2.113066952106162,0,1.242254990896953,0,0.5106933836176891,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0,0,0.8680769611044408,0,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0,0,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,0,1.2240432714951537,0,0,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.23909030129956546,0,1.9809875619754815,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0,1.562879575411247,0,0,0,0,0.8126923312097281,1.0821216224000123,0.5738004229273791,0,0.4217898584760213,0,0.4340384805522204,0,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,8,10,19,21,28,29,30,32,34,35,36,37,40,41,43,45,46,47,48,49,50,53,55,56,57,60,61,63,66,67,68,70,78,79,82,85,90,91,92,94,96,98,99,100,101],"values":[119,0.9744,0.4671906878691208,0.4784902431230542,0.8953840470548413,0.34070654076000123,0.9855351440491389,0.6931471805599453,0.9798378778933541,1.4726387048503082,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0.3018667074437374,0.6250937173149297,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,0.6250937173149297,2.113066952106162,1.242254990896953,0.5106933836176891,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0.8126923312097281,0.5863792051342392,0.8680769611044408,0.9569804862461084,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,1.2240432714951537,0.40195016600071987,0.6791609385852054,0.23909030129956546,1.9809875619754815,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,0.7814397877056235,1.562879575411247,0.8126923312097281,1.0821216224000123,0.5738004229273791,0.4217898584760213,0.4340384805522204,0.7214144149333415,0.5738004229273791,0.561377902928822,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.085699048388362","index":107},{"0":"Soundpeats GoFree 2","1":"I didn't try the original Soundpeats GoFree earbuds, but the second-gen GoFree 2s deliver a good value, with decent sound for open earbuds that sit on top of your ears -- there's a touch of distortion at higher volumes, but they have ample bass. While they don't quite look or feel like premium buds, they also don't look or feel cheap. They're missing premium features like ear-detection sensors (when you take one off, your music doesn't automatically pause), and their companion app for iOS and Android is a bit underwhelming. I found them pretty comfortable to wear (they fit securely) and their touch controls worked well. They're equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, have support for the LDAC audio codec for devices like Android phones that support it, and are IPX5 splash-proof. Battery life is rated up to nine hours at moderate volume levels and their case is one of the more compact cases I've seen for these types of earbuds.I thought voice-calling performance was acceptable, although not great. These are open earbuds, so they do let sound in, and it can be a little hard to hear callers in noisier environments.","3":"190","4":"0.9879","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0,0.5491078103370076,0,2.0059190453910123,0.9484938723687899,2.772588722239781,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,0.321098069371625,0,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0,0.5738004229273791,0,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,0,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0,0.9855351440491389,0,1.8112002446624245,0,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,0,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,0,1.9961028493586088,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.2457446338395524,0.651761964397091,0,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,0,0.8039003320014397,0,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,3.0088785680865184,0,1.562879575411247,0,0,0,0,0,1.0821216224000123,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.5022688764205891,1.0821216224000123,0,0,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,8,11,15,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,26,27,28,30,32,33,35,36,37,39,41,43,44,45,47,48,50,51,53,54,55,57,58,59,60,61,63,64,66,68,69,70,72,75,79,80,81,82,83,85,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,101],"values":[190,0.9879,0.5991182309116689,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.34070654076000123,1.2501874346298594,0.5491078103370076,2.0059190453910123,0.9484938723687899,2.772588722239781,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,1.5938879484831778,1.2669476034873244,0.321098069371625,0.7217205530040013,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5738004229273791,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,0.9855351440491389,1.8112002446624245,1.242254990896953,0.8899351021688214,0.25534669180884456,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0.5863792051342392,0.4746563726123323,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.4784902431230542,1.9961028493586088,0.7661723155748351,0.48991893894667704,1.2457446338395524,0.651761964397091,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,0.8039003320014397,0.23909030129956546,0.9668430110369864,0.565996446278709,0.6250937173149297,0.9056001223312122,1.2058504980021596,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0.7814397877056235,3.0088785680865184,1.562879575411247,1.0821216224000123,0.5738004229273791,0.7814397877056235,0.21089492923801065,0.6791609385852054,0.4340384805522204,1.5022688764205891,1.0821216224000123,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"7.668598573737598","index":108},{"0":"Soundpeats RunFree","1":"After releasing the RunFree Lite neckband-style open sports buds last year, Soundpeats has come up with a new, upgraded version with a more flexible and comfortable design and better sound.

Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, they're IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 17 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels (expect to get less than that because you will likely play these at high volume levels, especially outdoors where you'll encounter more ambient noise).

The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, though they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.While they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors, and they only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's in part due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side -- they feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water. The companion app for iOS is fairly basic, but you can upgrade the firmware and tweak the sound profile with a customizable EQ option.","3":"301","4":"0.9946","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,0,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,0.6250937173149297,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0,0.5491078103370076,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.963294208114875,0,2.886882212016005,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,1.7214012687821372,1.149164567830941,0.9056001223312122,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,2.113066952106162,2.1219954466557054,1.242254990896953,1.7798702043376429,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,2.9005290331109594,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,2.829327262207607,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,0.7661723155748351,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,0,2.0626613766562842,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,2.411700996004319,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0,1.6979893388361271,1.0045833390198333,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0,1.0029595226955061,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0,3.0045377528411783,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,1.6841337087864658,2.037482815755616]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[301,0.9946,0.5991182309116689,0,1.4354707293691626,0.7511344382102946,1.0500205175158943,0,0,0.9668430110369864,1.9710702880982778,0.6250937173149297,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0,0.5491078103370076,0,0.5014797613477531,0.9484938723687899,2.0794415416798357,0.9343813757382416,0.9798378778933541,0.7969439742415889,1.2669476034873244,0.963294208114875,0,2.886882212016005,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,1.0263516022218886,1.7214012687821372,1.149164567830941,0.9056001223312122,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,1.122755805857644,0.6037334148874748,0,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,2.113066952106162,2.1219954466557054,1.242254990896953,1.7798702043376429,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,2.9005290331109594,0.2829982231393545,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7119845589184984,2.829327262207607,0.8680769611044408,0.6120216357475768,0.9569804862461084,1.4726387048503082,0,0.7661723155748351,1.9596757557867082,0.3114361584598881,0,2.0626613766562842,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,1.3862943611198906,2.411700996004319,0.6791609385852054,0.3586354519493482,0,1.6979893388361271,1.0045833390198333,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,1.024001424876935,0,1.0029595226955061,0,0.7814397877056235,1.490091154801534,1.0221196222800037,0.7814397877056235,0.9484938723687899,0.8126923312097281,2.5249504522666952,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,1.3583218771704109,0,3.0045377528411783,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,1.6841337087864658,2.037482815755616]},"7":"7.999707369250166","index":111},{"0":"SteelSeries Arctis 1","1":"If you want a much more affordable alternative to the 9X, check out the Arctis 1, a well-designed (but less swanky) wireless model that sells for about $90.

The step-down EAH-AZ40 also sounds good but the EAH-AZ60 not only has larger drivers (8mm compared to 6mm) but also supports Sony's LDAC audio codec and has two additional microphones for voice calling and noise canceling (the EAH-AZ40 doesn't have noise canceling).","3":"167","4":"0.9786","5":{"type":1,"values":[0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,0,1.5044392840432592,1.8969877447375798,0.6931471805599453,0.4671906878691208,0,0,0,0.321098069371625,3.9547226936246247,0,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,0,0.3018667074437374,0,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,3.1314121565193442,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,0,0,1.242254990896953,0,0.5106933836176891,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0,0.7119845589184984,0.7073318155519017,2.170192402761102,0,0,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0,0.40195016600071987,0,0.11954515064978273,0,0.8489946694180636,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,0.9056001223312122,0,0.5863792051342392,0,0.40195016600071987,0,2.04800284975387,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0,0,0,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0,0.6326847877140319,0.6791609385852054,1.7361539222088815,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,1.7214012687821372,0,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,12,14,15,17,18,19,20,24,25,27,28,29,30,32,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,43,45,46,47,48,49,51,52,53,56,57,58,60,61,62,63,64,66,68,70,72,75,77,79,81,82,83,85,91,92,94,95,96,97,98,99,101],"values":[167,0.9786,0.5991182309116689,0.9343813757382416,0.4784902431230542,0.7511344382102946,0.7363193524251541,0.5991182309116689,0.5491078103370076,1.5044392840432592,1.8969877447375798,0.6931471805599453,0.4671906878691208,0.321098069371625,3.9547226936246247,0.5863792051342392,0.7363193524251541,0.5131758011109443,1.1476008458547582,0.3018667074437374,1.2501874346298594,0.7814397877056235,0.561377902928822,0.6037334148874748,3.1314121565193442,0.9855351440491389,0.6250937173149297,1.242254990896953,0.5106933836176891,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,0.7119845589184984,0.7073318155519017,2.170192402761102,0.7363193524251541,0.6653676164528696,0.7661723155748351,0.3114361584598881,0.651761964397091,1.2375968259937706,0.6120216357475768,0.7073318155519017,0.40195016600071987,0.11954515064978273,0.8489946694180636,1.2501874346298594,0.9056001223312122,0.5863792051342392,0.40195016600071987,2.04800284975387,1.562879575411247,0.5014797613477531,0.7814397877056235,1.442828829866683,0.5738004229273791,0.6326847877140319,0.6791609385852054,1.7361539222088815,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,1.7214012687821372,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"7.96661460186506","index":114},{"0":"Tranya Nova","1":"Tranya's Nova earbuds not only sound surprisingly good but also offer good noise-canceling performance for their modest price. Although you can tweak their sound with the equalizer in Tranya's companion app, at their balanced setting, they seem a bit more tuned to today's popular music, including hip hop and rap, delivering a full dose of bass (the buds have 12mm drivers) while not sounding boomy. Equipped with a Qualcomm 3072 chip that supports Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec and LE Audio, they're IPX5 splashproof and also have an ambient mode that lets sound in, plus a low-latency gaming mode. Multipoint Bluetooth pairing is supported as well.Battery life is rated at six hours at moderate volume levels with noise canceling on (I got more like five hours) and up to nine hours with ANC off. The glossy black charging case, which offers wireless charging, does show fingerprints but is easy enough to wipe down, as are the buds themselves. I thought the touch controls worked well, and callers said that while they heard a lot of background noise, they could hear my voice clearly during calls (the buds have three mics on each bud).While they're missing such premium features as ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the buds out of your ears, you couldn't ask for too much more from buds in this price range.","3":"227","4":"0.9781","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0.9343813757382416,1.9139609724922169,0,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.9127757897667107,0,0.9484938723687899,0,0.4671906878691208,0.9798378778933541,3.1877758969663557,0,0.321098069371625,0,2.165161659012004,1.1727584102684785,2.2089580572754626,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0,1.122755805857644,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0,1.875281151944789,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,0,0.4449675510844107,1.787426842661912,0,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0,1.7591376154027176,0.7119845589184984,0,1.3021154416566612,0,0.4784902431230542,0,1.9961028493586088,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,1.303523928794182,1.2375968259937706,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0,0.4781806025991309,0,0.565996446278709,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,1.509333537218687,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,1.539527403332833,2.04800284975387,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,1.6841337087864658,0.6791609385852054]},"6":{"type":1,"values":[227,0.9781,0,0.9343813757382416,1.9139609724922169,0,0.5250102587579472,1.7907680941096826,0.6814130815200025,0.9668430110369864,0,1.875281151944789,1.4726387048503082,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.9127757897667107,0,0.9484938723687899,0,0.4671906878691208,0.9798378778933541,3.1877758969663557,0,0.321098069371625,0,2.165161659012004,1.1727584102684785,2.2089580572754626,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,0,1.509333537218687,1.024001424876935,1.2501874346298594,0,1.122755805857644,0.3018667074437374,1.0438040521731147,0,1.875281151944789,0.9056001223312122,0.7073318155519017,0,0.4449675510844107,1.787426842661912,0,0.9668430110369864,0.2829982231393545,0,1.7591376154027176,0.7119845589184984,0,1.3021154416566612,0,0.4784902431230542,0,1.9961028493586088,0,0.9798378778933541,0.9343084753796642,1.303523928794182,1.2375968259937706,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0,0.4781806025991309,0,0.565996446278709,0,1.2501874346298594,0,0,1.509333537218687,1.318240897874875,0.5863792051342392,1.08462604669337,0.40195016600071987,1.539527403332833,2.04800284975387,0.7814397877056235,1.0029595226955061,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,1.0821216224000123,1.1476008458547582,0,0.4217898584760213,0,1.3021154416566612,0.7511344382102946,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,1.6841337087864658,0.6791609385852054]},"7":"8.747163814633405","index":115},{"0":"Tranya T20","1":"The Tranya T20 reminds me a little of a cheaper version of Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 without the noise canceling. They're pretty no-frills and missing more premium features such as an ear-detection sensor that automatically pauses your music when you take a bud out of your ears. They sound surprisingly decent for their modest price, if you get a tight seal, they sit pretty flush with your ears (they don't really stick out much) and they have decent battery life -- up to eight hours at moderate volume levels. They also work pretty well for making calls and are IPX7 waterproof.  The case feels a little cheap and the buds are lightweight. The Galaxy Buds 2 definitely feels more premium. The buds are well-tuned and have a relatively wide soundstage. Don't expect the world from them and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.","3":"143","4":"0.9545","5":{"type":1,"values":[1.1982364618233379,0,0.4784902431230542,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0,0.5991182309116689,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.469756816840031,0.7969439742415889,0,0.321098069371625,0,0,0,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0.6250937173149297,0,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,1.0438040521731147,0,0,0.6037334148874748,0.7073318155519017,0,0.4449675510844107,1.2767334590442228,0.8286926725561693,0,0.8489946694180636,1.6253846624194561,0,0,0,0,0.6120216357475768,0,0,1.9961028493586088,0,0.48991893894667704,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,0,0,1.3583218771704109,0.11954515064978273,1.9336860220739729,0,2.0091666780396666,1.2501874346298594,0,1.1716374236829996,0,0,0,0,1.2058504980021596,0,0,0.7814397877056235,0,0.8126923312097281,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0,1.8969877447375798,0,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,0,0.8680769611044408,0,0,0,0.561377902928822,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,2,4,11,12,14,21,22,24,28,29,32,34,36,37,38,41,42,44,45,46,48,49,54,57,59,60,61,62,63,64,67,68,69,71,72,74,79,82,84,87,89,91,92,93,94,96,100,101],"values":[143,0.9545,1.1982364618233379,0.4784902431230542,0.6250937173149297,0.7363193524251541,0.5991182309116689,1.469756816840031,0.7969439742415889,0.321098069371625,0.7363193524251541,1.539527403332833,0.6037334148874748,0.6250937173149297,0.561377902928822,0.9056001223312122,1.0438040521731147,0.6037334148874748,0.7073318155519017,0.4449675510844107,1.2767334590442228,0.8286926725561693,0.8489946694180636,1.6253846624194561,0.6120216357475768,1.9961028493586088,0.48991893894667704,0.9343084753796642,0.651761964397091,0.41253227533125686,0.6120216357475768,1.4146636311038034,1.3583218771704109,0.11954515064978273,1.9336860220739729,2.0091666780396666,1.2501874346298594,1.1716374236829996,1.2058504980021596,0.7814397877056235,0.8126923312097281,0.34070654076000123,1.8969877447375798,0.36070720746667073,1.1476008458547582,0.7814397877056235,0.8435797169520426,0.8680769611044408,0.561377902928822,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.525469092739595","index":116},{"0":"Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2","1":"If you can't quite afford Turtle Beach's Stealth 700 Gen 2, the Stealth 600 Gen 2 is a good alternative at under $100.

Its engineers tuned it to deliver even \"more detailed and precise  sound.\" I thought it sounded quite good, and the headset pairs to your phone and is also good for music listening and taking calls while you're gaming. There's an \"all-new\" Turtle Beach Hub app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak the audio and remap buttons. This headset will work with older Xbox One consoles as well as the next-gen Series consoles. Battery life is now up to 20 hours -- the headset charges via USB-C -- and thanks to Xbox Wireless technology, you can connect wirelessly to the Xbox without using a dongle like you have to do with the PS4. If you're looking at this versus the step-down Stealth 600 Gen 2, which retails for $80, that model is also good but the Stealth 700 Gen definitely has a more premium feel to it.

Featuring 50mm drivers with neodymium magnets, CCAW voice coils and fine-tuning by Roland engineers -- yes, V-Moda is now owned by Roland -- the M‑200 is Hi‑Res Audio-certified by the Japan Audio Society.

It would be nice if V-Moda offered Lightning or USB-C cables for phones without headphone jacks.Note that last year V-Moda released the  ($350), a wireless version of these headphones that includes active noise canceling. They also sound great, but their noise cancellation, call quality and overall feature set don't match those of the AirPods Max.","3":"161","4":"0.9643","5":{"type":1,"values":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,0,1.2501874346298594,2.2089580572754626,1.2501874346298594,0,2.1964312413480305,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0,0,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,0,1.2669476034873244,0,0,3.6086027650200063,0,0,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.9710702880982778,0,0.6037334148874748,0,0,1.7798702043376429,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,1.1727584102684785,0.4746563726123323,0,0.4340384805522204,2.4480865429903074,2.392451215615271,0,0,0,0,0.3114361584598881,0,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0.9668430110369864,0,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,0,0,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,0,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,2.04800284975387,0,1.0029595226955061,0,0,0,0.34070654076000123,2.3443193631168704,0,0,0.36070720746667073,0,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0.8680769611044408,0,0.7214144149333415,0,0,1.3583218771704109]},"6":{"type":0,"size":102,"indices":[0,1,8,9,11,12,13,15,16,17,20,21,23,26,29,30,31,32,39,41,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,53,54,55,60,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,71,72,75,76,78,79,80,81,83,87,88,91,93,94,95,96,98,101],"values":[161,0.9643,0.34070654076000123,0.9668430110369864,1.2501874346298594,2.2089580572754626,1.2501874346298594,2.1964312413480305,0.9127757897667107,1.0029595226955061,0.4671906878691208,0.48991893894667704,1.2669476034873244,3.6086027650200063,0.5131758011109443,0.5738004229273791,1.149164567830941,0.6037334148874748,1.9710702880982778,0.6037334148874748,1.7798702043376429,0.25534669180884456,0.8286926725561693,0.9668430110369864,1.131992892557418,0.8126923312097281,1.1727584102684785,0.4746563726123323,0.4340384805522204,2.4480865429903074,2.392451215615271,0.3114361584598881,0.41253227533125686,1.2240432714951537,0.7073318155519017,0.6931471805599453,0.8039003320014397,0.6791609385852054,0.11954515064978273,0.9668430110369864,1.0045833390198333,0.6250937173149297,0.3018667074437374,1.318240897874875,2.16925209338674,0.8039003320014397,1.0263516022218886,2.04800284975387,1.0029595226955061,0.34070654076000123,2.3443193631168704,0.36070720746667073,0.7814397877056235,0.4217898584760213,1.3583218771704109,0.8680769611044408,0.7214144149333415,1.3583218771704109]},"7":"8.64876336779903","index":119}],"schema":[{"key":"0","name":"product_name","type":"string"},{"key":"1","name":"review","type":"string"},{"key":"2","name":"rating","type":"float"},{"key":"3","name":"ReviewLength","type":"int"},{"key":"4","name":"SentimentPolarity","type":"double"},{"key":"5","name":"TFIDFFeaturesDense","type":"org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.VectorUDT@3bfc3ba7"},{"key":"6","name":"features","type":"org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.VectorUDT@3bfc3ba7"},{"key":"7","name":"prediction","type":"double"}],"truncated":false},"isSummary":false,"language":"scala"},"persist_state":{"view":{"type":"details","tableOptions":{},"chartOptions":{"chartType":"bar","categoryFieldKeys":["0"],"seriesFieldKeys":["0"],"aggregationType":"count","isStacked":false,"binsNumber":10,"wordFrequency":"-1"}}}}}},"spark_compute":{"compute_id":"/trident/default"},"dependencies":{"lakehouse":{"default_lakehouse":"506c0716-afa4-478f-b411-c2451fce4dc1","known_lakehouses":[{"id":"506c0716-afa4-478f-b411-c2451fce4dc1"}],"default_lakehouse_name":"P2","default_lakehouse_workspace_id":"ba403062-699a-4dcf-8de0-1a1a8d8e9968"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
